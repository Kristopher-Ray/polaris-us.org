Gabriel Noronha is the Executive Director of POLARIS National Security. Since co-founding POLARIS in 2021, Gabriel has become a leading advisor to Congress on national security policy and he regularly provides testimony and advice to the State Department, Treasury Department, Senate, and House of Representatives. His research on Iran, Russia, and China has been cited in dozens of letters, statements, testimonies, and pieces of legislation by Congress; and his policy recommendations have been passed into several laws. He exposed a major $10 billion nuclear deal between Russia and Iran and worked with Congress to sanction the program.

From 2019 to 2021, Gabriel served as Special Advisor for the Iran Action Group at the U.S. Department of State, where he coordinated policy that deprived the regime of around $200 billion that otherwise could have gone to support terrorism, and he directed the Department's communications and congressional affairs for Iran.

From 2017-2019, he worked as the Special Assistant for the Senate Armed Services Committee under Chairmen John McCain and Jim Inhofe, helping write, negotiate, and pass the annual national security legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

Gabriel worked for U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte from 2015-2016. He is also a fellow in JINSA's Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy. He previously served as Executive Director of the Forum for American Leadership and works on a range of national security and political projects. Gabriel speaks and conducts research in Russian, Mandarin, and Spanish.
