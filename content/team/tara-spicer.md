Tara Spicer is a seasoned strategist with over 20 years of political experience. Tara is the Finance Director for Team Graham, Inc., the campaign committee for US Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). She is a Partner in Strategic Partners of SC, a South Carolina based political firm specializing in issue management, fundraising and event planning – both corporate and political.

Since January 2019, Tara has led the finance operations for South Carolina’s senior Senator, Lindsey Graham. During the 2020 election cycle, Team Graham, Inc. raised a record $112 million in support of Senator Graham’s re-election campaign. This was achieved through national and in-state fundraising events coupled with unprecedented digital and direct mail fundraising. The South Carolina senate campaign was the most expensive race of all senate campaigns during the 2020 election cycle nationwide and set a new SC record for campaign spending.

In her role as Senator Graham’s Finance Director, Tara has worked on behalf of a number of conservative initiatives and campaigns that Senator Graham is close to, including POLARIS National Security, an advocacy organization that supports a strong America via peace through strength, and the 2024 Trump 47 Re-election Committee, among others.
