title: The Case for American Global Leadership
summary: "As the world grapples with unprecedented challenges and uncertainties, one thing has become clear: A new era of great power competition calls for a new era of American global leadership. With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine catapulting the European continent into the largest land war since World War II and the Chinese Communist Party setting its sights firmly on Taiwan, America’s leadership on the world stage is vital. Democracy is under attack, and authoritarianism is on the rise as malign actors seek to create chaos and profit from its gain."
