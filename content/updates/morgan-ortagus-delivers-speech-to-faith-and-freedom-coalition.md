title: POLARIS Founder Morgan Ortagus Delivers Speech to Faith and Freedom Coalition
summary: " There is a war afoot that demands a response from all Americans of faith. Unlike <a href='https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russia/' target='_blank'>Russia</a>’s war in <a href='https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/' target='_blank'>Ukraine</a>, this one is waged in secret. It is a war against the children of Abraham. Whether the victims are Christians, Muslims or Jews, this war is against those who believe there is just one God. "
