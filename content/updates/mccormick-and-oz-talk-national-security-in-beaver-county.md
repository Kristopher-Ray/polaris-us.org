title: McCormick and Oz talk national security in Beaver County
summary: "At a joint panel discussion in Beaver County last week, Republicans David McCormick and Dr. Mehmet Oz brought two things center stage that have fallen off the radar of the current political conversation: party unity and national security. The former Republican primary rivals shared a stage as part of a panel discussion sponsored by the POLARIS National Security group, whose founder, Morgan Ortagus, was the moderator."
