SiriusXM today announced that Morgan Ortagus, former State Department Spokeswoman under the Trump administration, will host a Sunday news and foreign policy program for **SiriusXM Patriot channel 125.** **Premiering this Sunday, December 10, The Morgan Ortagus Show will air live from 11 am – 1 pm EST** and will regularly broadcast live from key locations all over the globe.



Every Sunday on her new program, Ortagus will utilize her nearly two-decades of foreign policy expertise to help listeners better understand the key issues around the world, with a heavy focus on Israel and the Middle East. She’ll also regularly interview national security leaders, politicians, and other geopolitical experts, with Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien expected to be guests on her first program.

“I am thrilled and grateful to SiriusXM for giving me the wonderful opportunity to host a show focused on what’s happening around the world and America’s role in it,” said Ortagus. “We face chaos and war in almost every region of the world, and I will help our listeners better understand what it means for us, and how we should lead through turbulent times.”

The Morgan Ortagus Show will air on SiriusXM Patriot, which is SiriusXM’s home for news, politics, and commentary from a comprehensive conservative viewpoint. The channel features hard-hitting interviews and thought-provoking commentary from hosts including David Webb, Andrew Wilkow, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Stacy Washington, Breitbart News, and more.
