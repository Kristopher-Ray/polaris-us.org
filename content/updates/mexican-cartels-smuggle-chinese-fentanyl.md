title: Mexican Cartels Smuggle Chinese Fentanyl
date: 2022-06-06
summary: " Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-45. It
  ruins lives, breaks apart families, and destroys communities. It is hell.  The
  Chinese Communist Party looks the other way as their own companies fuel
  cartels with deadly chemicals. Cartels smuggle this poison across our southern
  border with ease. "
