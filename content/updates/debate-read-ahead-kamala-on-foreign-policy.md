Tonight, Kamala will try to hide her national security record and make empty promises about defending America. But we already know what the results of her presidency would be: Joe 2.0. ***America is less safe and weaker than she was four years ago.***



###### ***Three Key Points***

1. **She’s Dishonest.** Kamala still refuses to accept responsibility for the border crisis, the Afghanistan withdrawal, and hiding Biden’s decline.  Now, she is changing her position on everything from the border wall to Iran. Americans deserve accountability.
2. **She’s Weak.** As VP, she appeased at every turn – whether it was toward anti-Semitic protesters, the Houthis and their masters in Tehran, or the authoritarians in China and Russia. That’s because she truly believes strength is provocative and weakness is safer. 
3. **She’s Radical.** Let’s be clear – Kamala is the most extreme and leftist nominee in American history.  Her positions range from problematic to absurd. It’s no wonder she is trying to run away from her record as the most progressive member of the Senate.

 

###### ***What’s Her Record?***

1. **Undermining Security at Home**

   * ***As Border Czar***. Biden gave her one job—working on immigration policy. The result has been the worst border invasion in American history: millions of unknown migrants, floods of fentanyl and terrorism.
   * ***Defunding the Military*.** Kamala pushed real defense cuts four years in a row despite rising security threats and politicized our military with DEI. She demoralized our Armed Forces so much that we can’t even recruit anymore.
2. **Starting Crises that Never Should Have Happened**

   * ***Surrendering Afghanistan.*** She was the “last person in the room” pushing Biden to withdraw and praised his “courage” to leave. Spare us the lectures on women’s rights after handing millions of girls to the Taliban and abandoning Americans behind enemy lines.  
   * ***Emboldening Russia.*** Kamala played politics with oil: She killed our Keystone Pipeline to appease the climate lobby but refused to sanction Putin’s Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, making Europe more dependent on Russia. Then she withheld $300 million in aid from Ukraine and said they would only get it if they were invaded. What kind of deterrence is that? Now, we’re stuck spending tens of billions.
3. **Strengthening America’s Adversaries**

   * ***Funding Attacks** on Israel by Appeasing Iran.* Kamala’s policies have bankrolled Iran’s war machine which sent billions to Hamas and Hezbollah. That money was used for October 7 and to take Americans hostage. Now she is backing anti-Semitic protesters and campus chaos. Iran almost has a nuclear weapon and is constantly attacking our soldiers, but she has no plan to stop it.
   * ***Emboldening China*.** Under Kamala, the CCP is fueling our fentanyl crisis, sending spy balloons, and inching closer to war in Taiwan and the Philippines. But her only response is to call for more diplomacy and give concession after concession. Nobody would celebrate her re-election more than Xi Jinping.



###### ***What America Needs***

1. **A Return to Peace Through Strength.** The best way to avoid war is with military strength. We will invest in our defenses to deter any foes from testing America.
2. **Adversaries that Fear Us.** Our enemies cannot be allowed to attack our interests. Dictators must know we will stand up to them and when we make threats, we keep them.
3. **Allies that Respect Us**. The days of free-riding on U.S. taxpayers are over. European allies must raise their NATO contributions and share the security burden with America.
