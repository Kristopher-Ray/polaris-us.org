  Honorary President, experts Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council
  of America, and Morgan Ortagus, founder of POLARIS National Security and
  former Spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State, engaged in a debate on
  the 2024 presidential election and its impact on the global Jewish community,
  Israel, and the future of democracy. The duo tackled pressing issues that all
  Jewish advocates need to know, such as identifying the most effective methods
  to combat rising antisemitism, how to protect Jewish students on campus, and
  how to stop Iran's axis of terror that threatens all of humankind.
