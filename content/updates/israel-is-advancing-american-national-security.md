Yesterday, Israel’s military preemptively struck Iran’s nuclear program and senior leadership to deny them a nuclear weapon.  This campaign will likely continue for one to two more weeks.

Israel has done the United States–and the world–an incredible favor in preventing an Iranian nuclear breakout.  As Iran strikes back, it is vital that America stands with our ally Israel.  No country in the world supports U.S. security needs more than Israel.  Every airstrike on IRGC assets, every strike against Iran’s nuclear program, and every hit on the regime’s terror proxies weakens America’s enemies and supports our national interests.

Backing Israel as it takes the fight to Iran’s regime is America First policy.  It clearly meets all three foreign policy criteria laid out by President Trump’s team: making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous.  And it ensures this terrorist regime–which tried to assassinate President Trump and threatens nuclear genocide on Israel–is held to account once and for all.

##### What Israel Has Already Accomplished

* Inflicted Significant Damage on Iran’s Nuclear Program. Israel struck the Natanz nuclear facility in central Iran–a key site for producing fissile material for a bomb–as well as Isfahan, a uranium conversion facility and stocks of enriched uranium.  That comes amid reports Iran was planning to provide its nuclear weapons to its terrorist proxies.
* Neutralized Iran’s Nuclear Scientists. At least ten scientists central to Tehran’s weapons program are confirmed dead, including the former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization Fereydoon Abbasi and physicist Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi.
* Eliminated Iran’s Senior Chain of Command. In just hours, Israel isolated Supreme Leader Khameinei and killed some 20 top military Iranian commanders, including:
* * Ali Shamkhani, senior advisor to Supreme Leader Khamenei.
  * Maj. General Mohammad Bagheri, Chief of the General Staff of Iran’s military.
  * Hossein Salami, Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
  * Brig. General Esmail Ghaani, IRGC Quds Force Commander.
  * Brig. General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force.
  * Maj. General Gholamali Rashid, Commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central HQ.
  * Gholamreza Mehrabi, Dep. Head of Intelligence of the Armed Forces General Staff.
  * Mehdi Rabbani, Dep. Head of Operations of the Armed Forces General Staff.
  * Gholam-Reza Marhabi, Intelligence Dept. Head of the Iranian Armed Forces.
  * 30 IRGC air force commanders and personnel in one strike.
* Impeded Many of Iran’s Counter-Strike Capabilities.  The strikes also decimated at least 40 of Iran’s air-defense installations, ballistic-missile launchers, and parts of its vast missile arsenal.  Israel now enjoys full freedom of operation in Tehran's airspace.

However, the job is not done.  Several nuclear facilities remain intact, as do large stockpiles of ballistic missiles, their production facilities, Iran’s energy infrastructure, and more.  We must have Israel’s back as they finish the job, and we must help protect both Americans and Israeli civilians from Iranian retribution.

##### President Trump Gave Iran Every Opportunity to Choose Peace

* For months, President Trump dispatched Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to try and achieve a diplomatic solution to Iran’s nuclear program.  The U.S. has conducted five rounds of talks, months of painstaking negotiation, and offered Tehran a path to prosperity. All Trump demanded was one thing: that Tehran relinquish its nuclear program.
* How did Iran respond?  By giving President Trump a middle finger and ignoring his [60-day deadline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/trump-says-he-gave-iran-a-60-day-ultimatum-today-is-day-61-now-they-have-perhaps-a-second-chance/).  The regime showed again and again it was not interested in peace.  Iran chose this path.
* The Trump Administration has been consistent since day one: Iran would be forced to relinquish its nuclear program–and it was up to them whether that happened the easy way or the hard way.
* Some have argued Israel’s strikes were an attempt to “sabotage” President Trump’s diplomacy.  That’s clearly not the case; Israel briefed President Trump in advance and coordinated closely on the strikes.  President Trump called the strikes “[excellent](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-tells-abc-israel-strikes-iran-excellent-warns/story?id=122807155),” said he gave Iran every chance “and they didn't take it,” and that “there’s more to come–a lot more” if Iran refuses to stand down.
* The Trump Administration gave diplomacy a 60-day clock.  That deadline ended yesterday and Israel enforces the consequences of President Trump’s threats.

##### These Strikes Were Necessary

* Without these strikes, Iran’s genocidal leaders would have been a heartbeat away from a nuclear arsenal.  The Jewish people already endured one Holocaust —Israel took a justified and prudent action to ensure there won’t be a second  one.
* Iran’s intentions are clear: their mission is to annihilate the entirety of Israel. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called Israel a “cancerous tumor” and vowed it “will be uprooted and destroyed.”  In May 2024, he told Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, “The divine promise to eliminate the Zionist entity will be fulfilled and we will see the day when Palestine will rise from the river to the sea.”  In 2023, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated he hoped to “witness the final moments of Israel’s existence.”  Letting evil terrorists get their hands on a nuclear weapon would be an unacceptable proliferation risk and an existential threat to Israel and its survival.
* Israel has every right to take preemptive action to defend its people and its land.  It is acting the way any nation would under the threat of annihilation: by neutralizing the adversary.

##### What Do Americans Think?

* Even a [liberal Harvard poll](https://harvardharrispoll.com/key-results-may-4/) can’t hide it: Americans overwhelmingly reject the idea of a nuclear Iran.  80% of Americans say Iran must be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons.  The American public overwhelmingly supports tough action to stop Tehran’s nuclear ambitions–and they’re ready to back policies that ensure it.
* And a new poll this week [shows](https://harvardharrispoll.com/press-release-june-2025-special-report/) that large majorities of Americans - and 78% of Republicans - want the United States to support Israel in its strikes against Iran.
* Two-thirds of Americans also believe the best way to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is not via negotiations, but by isolating the regime, imposing sanctions, and raising the costs of pursuing nukes.

##### Policy Failures That Strengthened Iran

* U.S. policy decisions under the Biden administration allowed Iran to significantly advance its nuclear and regional military capabilities without consequence.  Rather than confronting Iran’s expanding threat network, the administration prioritized diplomacy while relaxing enforcement of key sanctions.  As a result, Iran’s uranium enrichment levels rose dramatically—up to 60% purity—and weaponization activities freely advanced. Meanwhile, Iranian proxies gained strength across the region.
* Since October 7, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have launched well over 200 attacks against U.S. personnel–a 630% increase.  In 2023, the IAEA confirmed Iran conducted uranium enrichment up to 83.7%—near weapons-grade.  But despite these developments, the Biden Administration continued to ease pressure on the regime and refused to enforce energy sanctions.
* Sanctions enforcement on Iranian oil exports, particularly to China, [weakened](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-iran-south-china-sea-oil-trade/?embedded-checkout=true) significantly under Biden, allowing Tehran to increase revenues and fund its network of militias from Lebanon to Yemen.  These funds helped sustain groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis—contributing directly to the regional instability that culminated in the October 7 attacks.
* In the absence of decisive leadership, Israel acted to fill the void. Its operations severely disrupted [Hezbollah’s infrastructure](https://www.newsweek.com/iran-israel-conflict-escalates-battered-hezbollah-stays-out-fight-2085115), degraded Hamas’s capabilities, and weakened Iran-backed forces in Yemen.
* While diplomatic engagement can be a tool, recent years have shown that pressure, not leniency, is what curtails Iranian aggression.  Iran’s weakened position today is the result of external resistance—not a product of accommodation.

##### Israel Is Fighting America’s Enemy

* The United States has significant national security interests with Iran, including: preventing nuclear proliferation, preventing attacks on U.S. bases and personnel from Iranian missiles, and stopping Iranian assassination plots. Israel is advancing our interests in each of these files.
* This regime plotted to assassinate President Trump and his team.  It is the world’s leading funder of terrorism.  If Iran attacks Americans, the regime must face overwhelming force from the United States.
* Protecting our troops and our citizens from Iranian missile threats, ensuring we will never face a nuclear attack from Iran, and killing potential assassins before they strike Americans - these are all America First victories that Israel is delivering for us.
* Hundreds of thousands of Americans live in Israel, making it one of the largest U.S. expat populations in the world.  Israel is not just defending its own people – it’s defending Americans.

Israel’s bold actions are making America and the world safer.  **Iran started this war, but with our help, Israel can finish it.**
