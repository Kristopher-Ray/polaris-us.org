date: 2023-10-20T18:56:32.078Z
summary: How are the U.S. and Europe punishing Iran for its advancing nuclear
  program and its involvement in Hamas’ slaughter of Israeli, European, and
  American citizens? They aren’t. In fact, on Wednesday, they just allowed the
  UN embargo on Iran’s purchase and sale of missiles and missile technology to
  expire.
