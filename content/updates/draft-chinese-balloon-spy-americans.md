Our nation has a debt problem fueled by out-of-control welfare programs and decades of irresponsible decisions. We must spend less. Speaker McCarthy earned some important concessions from the White House to cap Democrats’ relentless waste and transparent attempts to buy votes on the backs of American taxpayers.

However, the debt ceiling agreement codifies Biden’s incredibly dangerous defense budget and - taking Biden's historic inflation into account - would shrink our military by around 6% in real terms over the next two years, which is unpalatable considering the threats we face.

We stand on the brink of a major war in the Pacific with Communist China, whose fleet size exceeds ours and whose public military budget is increasing 6.2% this year alone. Over 300,000 American were wounded or killed in the Pacific Theater during World War II. If this debt agreement is passed without revision, we will hand over military superiority to China, and wave a green flag for Beijing’s aggression in a war we will not be equipped to win. In such a war, the losses to our economy would be in the trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives.

Finally, the Biden Budget takes the U.S. Navy from 298 ships to 291. The Chief of Naval Operations recently testified to Congress that the Navy needs 373 ships and 150 unmanned platforms to deal with the multiple threats we face. Biden’s budget destroys our ability to reach that goal.

Bottom line: We need a defense budget that allows us to deter Chinese aggression.
