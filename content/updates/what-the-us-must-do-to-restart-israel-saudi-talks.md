title: What the US Must do to Restart Israel-Saudi Talks
date: 2023-12-06T21:03:56.822Z
summary: "In the wake of Hamas' October 7th attacks, we're staring down some
  tough realities in the region. The fragile peace and growing connections
  between Israel and its Arab neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia, has been
  derailed. This wasn't just another violent incident – it was a strategic play
  to disrupt the hard-won progress towards peace between Riyadh and Jerusalem. "
