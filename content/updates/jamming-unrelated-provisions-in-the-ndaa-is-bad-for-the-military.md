title: Jamming Unrelated Provisions in the NDAA Is Bad for the Military
date: 2023-08-01T20:02:52.314Z
summary: "The Senate and House Armed Services Committee (SASC and HASC) are
  justifiably proud that this year promises to be the 63rd straight year
  Congress will pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. No
  other committee comes close to matching this track record. However, this
  success poses the greatest threat to the NDAA’s continued success – both this
  year and institutionally. "
