Any remaining questions about Kamala’s dangerous foreign policy were laid to rest when she selected Tim Walz as her VP. His national security record leaves little to the imagination: He is a darling of the far-left who loves dictators and could **leave our country waltzing into war.**

***Claim:* *Walz & Kamala will stand up to China as strong, experienced leaders.*** 

***Reality:* *He has consistently downplayed concerns about the CCP and its threats.*** 

* Walz [claimed](https://archive.mpr.org/stories/2007/04/13/us-representative-tim-walz-delivers-foreign-policy-speech-at-university-of-minnesota) that worries about China’s awful authoritarian atrocities were “hyperbole.”
* He [said](https://x.com/MAGAIncWarRoom/status/1820823234951999622) the relationship isn’t “adversarial” and [forged](https://x.com/james_t_quinn/status/1820895981401219096) closer CCP ties as MN governor.
* Walz [called](https://archive.mpr.org/stories/2007/04/13/us-representative-tim-walz-delivers-foreign-policy-speech-at-university-of-minnesota) for avoiding “scary China” rhetoric and fawned over China as “amazing.”
* As recently as 2019, he [called](https://x.com/michaelsobolik/status/1820821861648769175) for more economic ties with China despite its rights abuses.
* He [told](https://x.com/michaelsobolik/status/1820865489519964461) students to “downplay their American-ness” and put a Chinese banner in his office. 

**\*Bottom Line:** With that record, it’s no wonder he honeymooned in Communist China in 1994.*

***Claim: Walz & Kamala will “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself.”*** 

***Reality: Dangerous anti-Semites and the radical left were thrilled at Walz pick.*** 

* He [praised](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/harris-vp-pick-tim-walz-and-his-views-palestine-israel-and-gaza-protests) anti-Semitic protesters as “civically engaged,” [validating](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-walz-kamala-harris-israel-gaza-pro-palestinian-protests-2024-8) their views as thoughtful. 
* He has [campaigned](https://x.com/MarinaMedvin/status/1820997019877380607) for and [appeared](https://x.com/Tim_Walz/status/1047525035852947456) with leading anti-Semites like Ilhan Omar.
* He conspicuously [missed](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2018398) a vote on a bill to enhance oversight on anti-Semitic incitement.
* No one [celebrated](https://x.com/AOC/status/1820819039955947605) his VP pick more than Bernie Sanders, AOC, and other anti-Israel radicals.
* He even [acknowledged](https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2024/03/07/gov-walz-says-minnesotas-45000-uncommitted-voters-are-civically-engaged) that anti-Israel pressure on Biden “bodes well” for him.

**\*Bottom Line:** Americans can be sure he would pander to far-left anti-Semites if elected.*

***Claim: They will “never hesitate” to defend America against Iran and its proxies.*** 

***Reality: Walz’s strategy would make Iran a nuclear-armed regional hegemon.*** 

* He championed the JCPOA wholeheartedly, [stating](https://x.com/GLNoronha/status/1820815760723185738) that he did not “know of a better deal.” 
* Walz saw no problem with giving Tehran $150 billion in sanctions relief to fund its terror.
* He [mocked](https://web.archive.org/web/20181222185808/https:/walz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walz-statement-on-iran-p51-nuclear-agreement) critics of the deal as blinded by “ideology.” Now even Kamala won’t support it!  
* Iran’s leaders routinely echo Walz’s [belief](https://web.archive.org/web/20181222185323/https:/walz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walz-statement-on-iran-nuclear-agreement) that sanctions aren’t a “long term” solution. 

***Bottom Line: The only thing Walz has never wavered in is appeasing America’s adversaries.***

***Claim: Walz & Kamala believe in “tough, smart solutions to secure the border.”*** 

***Reality: The only thing Walz believes in is border insecurity and more chaos.***

* He once[ joked](https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1820812490961256706) he would invest in a “ladder factory” to help migrants climb over a border wall. 
* Walz [voted](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2018297) against stopping catch-and-release and DHS detention of dangerous criminals.
* He signed MN laws to [grant](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/tim-walz-progressive-agenda-included-giving-drivers-licenses-free-tuition-to-illegal-immigrants/#:~:text=Since%20becoming%20governor%20in%202019,driver's%20licenses%20to%20illegal%20immigrants.) illegal migrants free tuition, drivers licenses, and health perks. 
* He [opposed](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017517) legislation to deport criminal alien gang members and [lauded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m9OBV6fxtk&t=43s) sanctuary cities. 
* He and Kamala called Trump’s border wall a “waste” but now [feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2F9qGxTKcU&t=2s) it in campaign ads. 

**\*Bottom Line:** Walz and Kamala can’t be trusted to restore order and defend our homeland.*

***Claim: They’ll “restore U.S. leadership” abroad and defend America’s values.*** 

***Reality: Walz has never met an authoritarian regime he didn’t like.***

* After meeting Syria’s Assad, Walz [opposed](https://www.minnpost.com/political-agenda/2013/09/congressman-walz-says-hell-vote-no-syria-intervention/) military action despite his chemical weapons use.
* He was a legislative ally of Cuba’s Castro regime, [co-sponsoring](https://x.com/AllianceForCuba/status/1820822444296290442) a bill to repeal the embargo.
* Walz [backed ](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223095542/https:/walz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walz-co-introduces-authorization-for-use-of-military-force-against-isis)the 2011 Iraq and 2021 Afghanistan withdrawals, fueling terrorist resurgences.
* He tried to [prevent](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223095542/https:/walz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walz-co-introduces-authorization-for-use-of-military-force-against-isis) U.S. forces from hitting dozens of terrorist groups by repealing AUMFs.

**\*Bottom Line:** Authoritarians and despots had few greater friends in Congress than Tim Walz.*

###### **Tim Walz’s national security record is more than weird–it’s dangerous. He has earned an F in national security. Kamala and Walz’s ideas will leave America waltzing toward weakness and war, and our enemies know it.**
