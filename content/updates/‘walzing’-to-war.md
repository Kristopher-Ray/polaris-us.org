Any remaining questions about Kamala’s dangerous foreign policy were laid to rest when she selected Tim Walz as her VP. His national security record leaves little to the imagination: He is a darling of the far-left who loves dictators and could **leave our country waltzing into war.**

***Claim:* *Walz & Kamala will stand up to China as strong, experienced leaders.*** 

***Reality:* *He has consistently downplayed concerns about the CCP and its threats.*** 

* Walz claimed that worries about China’s awful authoritarian atrocities were “hyperbole.”
* He said the relationship isn’t “adversarial” and forged closer CCP ties as MN governor.
* Walz called for avoiding “scary China” rhetoric and fawned over China as “amazing.”
* As recently as 2019, he called for more economic ties with China despite its rights abuses.
* He told students to “downplay their American-ness” and put a Chinese banner in his office. 

###### ***Bottom Line: With that record, it’s no wonder he honeymooned in Communist China in 1994.***

**Claim: Walz & Kamala will “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself.”** 

**Reality: Dangerous anti-Semites and the radical left were thrilled at Walz pick.** 

* He praised anti-Semitic protesters as “civically engaged,” validating their views as thoughtful. \
  Bottom Line: Americans can be sure he would pander to far-left anti-Semites if elected.
* He conspicuously missed a vote on a bill to enhance oversight on anti-Semitic incitement.
* No one celebrated his VP pick more than Bernie Sanders, AOC, and other anti-Israel radicals.
* He even acknowledged that anti-Israel pressure on Biden “bodes well” for him.

###### ***Bottom Line: Americans can be sure he would pander to far-left anti-Semites if elected.***

**Claim: They will “never hesitate” to defend America against Iran and its proxies.** 

**Reality: Walz’s strategy would make Iran a nuclear-armed regional hegemon.** 

* He championed the JCPOA wholeheartedly, stating that he did not “know of a better deal.” 
* Walz saw no problem with giving Tehran $150 billion in sanctions relief to fund its terror.
* He mocked critics of the deal as blinded by “ideology.” Now even Kamala won’t support it!  
* Iran’s leaders routinely echo Walz’s belief that sanctions aren’t a “long term” solution. 

###### ***Bottom Line: The only thing Walz has never wavered in is appeasing America’s adversaries.***

**Claim: Walz & Kamala believe in “tough, smart solutions to secure the border.”** 

**Reality: The only thing Walz believes in is border insecurity and more chaos.**

* He once joked he would invest in a “ladder factory” to help migrants climb over a border wall. 
* Walz voted against stopping catch-and-release and DHS detention of dangerous criminals.
* He signed MN laws to grant illegal migrants free tuition, drivers licenses, and health perks. 
* He opposed legislation to deport criminal alien gang members and lauded sanctuary cities. 
* He and Kamala called Trump’s border wall a “waste” but now feature it in campaign ads. 

###### ***Bottom Line: Walz and Kamala can’t be trusted to restore order and defend our homeland.***

Claim: They’ll “restore U.S. leadership” abroad and defend America’s values. Reality: Walz has never met an authoritarian regime he didn’t like.\
→ After meeting Syria’s Assad, Walz opposed military action despite his chemical weapons use.
