Hung and Jeremy are dedicated patriots with exemplary service in our nation’s military and are devoted husbands and fathers to their families.

You may already recognize Hung Cao and Jeremy Hunt from their time as Congressional candidates – they each ran competitive campaigns that drew significant national media attention. They were some of the country’s most effective messengers at demanding improvements to our military readiness and ensuring America leads abroad.

Jeremy recently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/dec/6/military-readiness-crisis-worsens-under-bidens-wat/" target="_blank">wrote</a> about the military’s disastrous readiness crisis that nearly claimed two U.S. Navy vessels and the lives of an untold number of our sailors. He also <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/jeremyhunt/2022/10/29/i-served-with-ukrainians-im-not-surprised-by-their-resolve-n2615200" target="_blank">shared</a> his experiences serving with Ukrainians now fighting for their survival.

At POLARIS we also know that our nation’s future cannot be secured unless our children can receive a stellar education unencumbered by racial prejudice. Hung Cao recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/04/21/erosion-excellence-thomas-jefferson-high-school/" target="_blank">spoke</a> out against state-sponsored discrimination rearing its head in Northern Virginia’s top public schools.

As someone who lived under communist rule, Hung Cao also uniquely understands the immense threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses to freedom in the United States. He <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6316406382112" target="_blank">joined</a> Fox & Friends earlier this month to discuss China’s ruthless COVID-19 lockdowns and his family’s tragic experiences under communism before escaping Vietnam in 1975.

Hung and Jeremy will help advance POLARIS’ mission to reach Americans across the media spectrum with fresh and diverse perspectives on why it is indispensable that America leads, that America is strong, and that American wins.
