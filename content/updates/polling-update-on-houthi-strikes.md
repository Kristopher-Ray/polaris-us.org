### **POLL: A Super-Majority of Americans Support the Houthi Strikes**

As the Trump Administration continues to restore deterrence in the Red Sea, new national Harvard-Harris [polling](https://harvardharrispoll.com/) proves what the White House has said all along: the vast majority of Americans support its airstrikes against Houthi terrorists.

#### **Key Findings**

* **Super-Majority Support for the Strikes**: According to the poll, 71% of Americans support President Trump’s decision to strike the Houthis and restore maritime security. That includes 58% of Democrats and a super-majority of independents.
* **America First, Not Leading From Behind:** 60% of voters surveyed said President Trump was right to have the United States conduct the strikes rather than wait on Europe to take action – showing clear support for an America First leadership approach.
* **The Republican Consensus is Clear**: An overwhelming share of Republicans – 86% – believe it was wise to strike the Houthi terrorists and almost three-quarters of Republicans didn’t think we should wait on Europe to take action.

**This poll shows Americans roundly reject the Biden Administration’s strategy of retreat in the Middle East.** It also proves just how unpopular its approach was: even a majority of Democrats acknowledge it was wrong to leave U.S. warships as sitting ducks for the Houthis to terrorize alongside commercial ships.

#### **Degrading the Houthis is in the National Interest:**

* **Re-opening the Suez Canal for international commerce supports American businesses, consumers, and demonstrates U.S. support for freedom of navigation.**
* Houthi attacks on international cargo ships forced them to spend between $500,000 (lower [EIA estimate](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61363)) and $1,000,000 (White House [estimate](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-standing-up-to-terrorism-and-protecting-international-commerce/)) in extra fuel costs circling around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. With around 20,000 tankers and commercial ships forced to divert from the Suez canal **since October 2023, the Houthi’s naval blockade has imposed between $10-20 billion in global economic damage**, costs passed on to American businesses and consumers.
* With 15% of global shipping traveling through the Suez Canal, shipping prices for 40-foot steel containers [rose](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-23/shipping-rates-for-containers-fuel-surge-anew-on-houthi-attacks-in-red-sea) from $1,500 to $6,000 (and as [high](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/business/houthi-red-sea-attacks-shipping-lanes-africa.html) as $8,700) per container, passing even more costs on to American businesses and consumers.

#### **The Biden Years: A Houthi Golden Age**

* **President Biden's appeasement of Iran fueled and funded Houthi attacks.** The White House [gave](https://8nithvebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001GQC8h-0VdmLVQa_zouhHVoFAD1C4BvoIVtAsSWpm8kmhsIpx-UzYkyJKS6CVxS-SpTpsiJqlQfVqjdGljrMXWBBhPmIFV8LZJDUZ34fGam7j7OXIlAa0SABfb8l4GVbA10QqmbNEBtA0v6YRlnG-Vd12FqHCBH44AcJKfY4ChtJKyD85BxbBlco9aK994qXNl4hpJHyiN2eoB70mxaPD-WM2oG77d-ArOTBLZ5uz3-XmGLZCpoaIocWI2ANzdYrqkRkD8Q_8cC-0VZJWhqga1g==&c=jQ_3fCya_UZJHbd4CvG8liRevJNT0O8T7wReqF1ZY_ozAbYOC1Vl_g==&ch=Ucyoqko8JjQSQI_LdUZDZMsFBecsVp0LJoCCvnIXc5fWE_VM3otwzA==) unprecedented sanctions relief to Iran and bankrolled its war machine with lax sanctions enforcement, allowing Tehran to [acquire](https://8nithvebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001GQC8h-0VdmLVQa_zouhHVoFAD1C4BvoIVtAsSWpm8kmhsIpx-UzYkz5LS6TTlQBPyjABfZ2HnnK2fPyZFDGfmHQrNR9MvfVjZXCF2eA1Tfi-NdVtxs01_ZNar0qv7_ZHNr92r8XtkLEJ_ifQ8mco-y3b5SUGs124mO43n7aCU9QnQHCfVjWqR3I4jCRNwSAEUub50HSmP0hXP-Jy6mCC5zpDX8RQEZ7voRriLKQWcibsi4YGBOlNt46Ht4zH50JufREHKM6eQ-Zr8jZ4EvleYw==&c=jQ_3fCya_UZJHbd4CvG8liRevJNT0O8T7wReqF1ZY_ozAbYOC1Vl_g==&ch=Ucyoqko8JjQSQI_LdUZDZMsFBecsVp0LJoCCvnIXc5fWE_VM3otwzA==) an extra $100 billion in oil sales.
* **This cash infusion enabled it to fund and supply the Houthis with training, weapons, and explosives.** The Houthis used this to acquire advanced weaponry, including suicide drones and ballistic missiles.
* **American weakness invited war**. For over a year, Houthi terrorists attacked ships and sailors while the Biden White House [refused](https://8nithvebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001GQC8h-0VdmLVQa_zouhHVoFAD1C4BvoIVtAsSWpm8kmhsIpx-UzYkz5LS6TTlQBPHMJWh_HzrNKWnumDaoYjUL7wq71J_XbWvHaZUkJKdp7EiTZjnjbOUTfxkfDKNPTjU8C9SgleBNEbtcHg_V4xHw2C1260CRUwXVALvxuybTvJp4PqldKHag==&c=jQ_3fCya_UZJHbd4CvG8liRevJNT0O8T7wReqF1ZY_ozAbYOC1Vl_g==&ch=Ucyoqko8JjQSQI_LdUZDZMsFBecsVp0LJoCCvnIXc5fWE_VM3otwzA==) to neutralize Houthi assets. Reactive half-measures signaled that attacks on the U.S. would face few consequences.
* **Biden proved that American inaction is provocative**.
