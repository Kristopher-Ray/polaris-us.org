Today, POLARIS National Security released a report detailing the preliminary costs of the Biden-Harris Administration's most severe deterrence failures over the last four years. 

After investigating the fiscal impact of these blunders, the report concludes that the Biden-Harris Administration's four most consequential deterrence failures — the illegal migration crisis at the Southern Border, Iran's proxy terrorism in the Middle East, Putin's war on Ukraine, and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan — have cost American taxpayers upwards of $381.4 billion. That translates to an alarming cost of over $2,902 for each U.S. household.
