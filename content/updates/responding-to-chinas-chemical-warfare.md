title: Responding to China’s chemical warfare
summary:  "Thousands are dying from fentanyl overdoses each month — over 71,000 died last year. It's time to call this what it is: chemical warfare. Drug cartels in Mexico manufacture and traffic their deadly wares across the border, with an unending supply of fentanyl precursors directly from China at their disposal. This crisis should have been at the top of the list of concerns when President Joe Biden recently met with Chinese President Xi Jinping . It didn’t garner a mention. "
