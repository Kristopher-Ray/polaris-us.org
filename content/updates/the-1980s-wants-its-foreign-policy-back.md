title: The 1980s Wants its Foreign Policy Back
date: 2024-06-18T16:06:28.830Z
summary: This week, Russian leader Vladimir Putin will arrive in North Korea for
  his third summit with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un—a mark of the
  growing bond between two top U.S. adversaries. Americans should always be
  vigilant of gatherings with nuclear-armed states, but the stakes of this
  summit of evil will be higher than most.
