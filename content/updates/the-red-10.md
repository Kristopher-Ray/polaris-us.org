title: "The Red 10: The Ten Worst Corporate Appeasers of Communist China"
date: 2023-12-18T14:05:31.060Z
summary: "The list of the CCP’s aggressive acts grows monthly – from supporting
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to flying a spy balloon over the continental
  United States. Such actions merit a robust response – not just from the U.S.
  government from every segment of society. The monumental task of preventing
  the CCP from carrying out its goals of domination cannot be achieved without
  the cooperation of the American business community. "
