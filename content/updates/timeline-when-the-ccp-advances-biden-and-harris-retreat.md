Earlier today, China [surrounded](https://www.newsweek.com/china-news-stages-blockade-taiwan-1968392) Taiwan with a record 125 warplanes in large-scale military exercises, staging a naval blockade to warn against “separatist acts.” That came just days after reports [emerged](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/drones-military-pentagon-defense-331871f4) of potential Chinese drones swarming U.S. national security facilities, including the base for SEAL Team Six and the world’s largest naval port in Norfolk.

True to form, the Biden-Harris Administration [responded](https://www.state.gov/prc-military-drills-near-taiwan-2/) with a strongly-worded statement calling on Beijing to “act with restraint.” Meanwhile, it [answered](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/drones-military-pentagon-defense-331871f4) the drone incursion with two weeks of meetings and no action—just like when it let the CCP fly its spy balloon across America.

Xi Jinping and the CCP have spent the last four years undermining our national security at every available opportunity but facing little consequence because of Biden and Harris’ failed strategy: attempting to “manage competition” with the CCP and avoid “provoking” Beijing.

This timeline recaps the Biden-Harris approach to China–four years of unforced errors and strategic blunders that have advanced the CCP’s position at the expense of America’s security.

* **CCP Greets President Biden with Sanctions During His Inaugural Address (January 20, 2021):** Just four minutes after President Biden took his oath of office, Beijing [announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/china-threw-down-the-gauntlet-to-the-biden-team-on-day-one/2021/01/21/2e5a84a8-5c24-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html) sanctions on 28 former U.S. officials and their families in an effort to threaten and intimidate the incoming White House into adopting a softer strategy. The provocative move showed the CCP’s confidence that such tactics could bully the Biden- Harris Administration into a strategy of accommodation.
* **Legitimizing a Human Rights Body That Shields China (February 8, 2021):** Overlooking the UN Human Rights Council’s refusal to even debate the Xinjiang genocide and other CCP abuses, President Biden instructed the State Department to [re-engage](https://www.state.gov/u-s-decision-to-reengage-with-the-un-human-rights-council/) “immediately and robustly” with the Council. Since then, the Biden-Harris Administration has failed to stop China’s membership or force a single resolution against the CCP for its mass detentions, forced labor, sterilizations, and "re-education" camps. For her part, Harris has given every indication she plans to continue U.S. participation on the Council through 2026, regardless of whether it holds China accountable.
* **Letting the CCP Lecture American Officials (March 19, 2021):** During U.S.-China talks in Alaska, a senior CCP diplomat openly [denigrated](https://www.c-span.org/video/?510091-1/us-china-summit-anchorage-alaska) America to Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan’s face, scolding them in a tirade with talking points ripped straight from progressive racial ideology. CCP officials said that America “does not have the qualification” to address China “from a position of strength,” that it does “not serve as a model to others,” and that “China’s rise was unstoppable.” Yang Jiechi accused the U.S. of “inciting other countries to attack China” and noted that “it is important for the United States to change its own image and stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world.” Despite enduring such disrespect, Blinken and Sullivan have rewarded China with diplomatic visits to Xi Jinping and CCP officials.
* **China, WHO Issue Misleading COVID-19 Report (March 30, 2021):** After an initial WHO investigation into the origins of the pandemic stalled, the WHO and China issued a joint report stating the most likely origin of COVID-19 was transmission from bats to an intermediate host to humans. The report was met with immediate skepticism about its methodology and process, including China’s control of the data and restriction of facilities accessed by the team members, who were fully vetted by the CCP.
* **Shutting Down State’s Investigation into COVID-19 Origins (May 26, 2021):** The Biden-Harris Administration [terminated](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/25/politics/biden-shut-down-trump-effort-coronavirus-chinese-lab/index.html) Foggy Bottom’s probe into the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s role in the COVID-19 outbreak, citing concerns about “quality of evidence” and “politicized” efforts to blame China. The move dismissed an effort to investigate the lab-leak theory, which was cast as a conspiracy.
* **Getting Duped by a CCP Influence Campaign (May 27, 2021):** Despite the State Department designating the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) as an affiliate of a Chinese intelligence service conducting influence operations, John Kerry [joined](https://dailycaller.com/2023/10/31/gavin-newsom-china-trip-intel/) a webinar hosted by the group in 2021. During the meeting, participants reportedly agreed to increase bilateral cooperation with the group.
* **Backing Down on Chinese Spy Apps (June 9, 2021):** President Biden [withdrew](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/09/1004750274/biden-replaces-trump-bans-on-tiktok-wechat-with-order-to-scrutinize-apps) Trump-era executive orders that sought to ban new downloads of dangerous Chinese espionage platforms such as WeChat and TikTok. He promised the Commerce Department would launch an “evidence-based” evaluation of apps with Chinese connections that may pose a security risk and “take action, as appropriate” based on those reviews. The move allowed TikTok usership to surge and enabled CCP espionage on Americans to continue unabated. Still, the CCP passed a law authorizing countermeasures the very next day, including seizing and freezing U.S. assets.
* **Fueling Chinese Industry (August 25, 2021):** Despite promising to protect American technology, the Biden Administration [approved](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bidens-huawei-reprieve-worth-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars/) licenses worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Huawei. Because of this, China’s blacklisted telecom company became eligible to buy chips for its auto component business and access commodities that could harm the United States.
* **Nominating a Export-Import Bank President with CCP Business Ties (September 13, 2021):** Reta Jo Lewis, President Biden’s nominee to lead the Export- Import Bank, [raised alarm](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2881725/nominee-to-lead-export-import-bank-is-second-biden-pick-advising-pro-china-group/?utm_source=gazette.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=csg_news_feed) on Capitol Hill due to her role as an advisor for the U.S.- China Heartland Association, a pro-China business group that partnered with CCP- linked organizations like the United Front Work Department. Her multi-decade history of advancing ties between CCP groups and U.S. subnational groups worried lawmakers about her ability to lead a U.S. agency used to outcompete China globally.
* **Refusing to Even Mention China at the UN (September 21, 2021):** In his remarks at the UN General Assembly, President Biden conspicuously [omitted](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2021-09-21/biden-xi-avoid-referencing-one-another-at-un-as-us-leader-softens-tone-on-china) references to China from his remarks. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the omission was part of his “objective of laying out our proactive agenda on the big issues we can work together on.”
* **Dismissing Chinese Human Rights Violations (November 11, 2021):** During COP26, Climate Envoy John Kerry [sidestepped](https://nypost.com/2021/11/11/john-kerry-china-human-rights-violations-not-my-lane/) a question about whether he had brought up China’s use of slave labor in Xinjiang for building solar panels in his meetings with CCP leaders. He responded by stating that the issue was “not my lane \[...] My job is to be the climate guy.” The comment showed Kerry’s willingness to downplay China’s human rights abuses to gain concessions for his misguided climate priorities. Conveniently, Kerry [held](https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/john-kerry-holds-1-million-stake-in-equity-fund-linked-to-uyghur-labor-abuse/) a $1 million stake in an investment fund backing the world’s largest solar panel maker, LONGi, a Chinese company that buys polysilicon from Xinjiang-linked companies.
* **Not Pressing Xi Jinping on COVID-19 Origins (November 18, 2021):** After President Biden held a virtual meeting with the CCP leader, a White House readout [indicated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/) that he had not inquired about the pandemic origins or Beijing’s refusal to share data to WHO investigators. The curious omission–especially on the heels of the Biden Administration terminating the State Department’s investigation into the origins of COVID-19–raised concerns the White House was uncommitted to uncovering China’s role in the pandemic.
* **Trying to Water Down Restrictions on Chinese Slave Labor Imports (December 2, 2021):** Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman [indicated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/02/congress-needs-act-xi-jinpings-genocide-now/) that the White House wanted a more “targeted and deliberative approach” to determining which Chinese goods are the products of forced labor. The comment referred to a provision in the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act that presumed that Xinjiang-originated products were tainted by forced labor unless the importer could prove otherwise.
* **Failing to Relocate Beijing’s Genocide Olympics (December 6, 2021):** After the White House failed to convince the International Olympic Committee to relocate the Winter Games from China, President Biden [announced](https://www.csis.org/analysis/biden-boycott-2022-beijing-winter-olympics) a diplomatic boycott of the event following bipartisan pressure from Capitol Hill. Even so, U.S. athletes participated in the tournament while Beijing put its authoritarian grip on full display by censoring online content, arresting dissidents, and staging an interview with tennis star Peng Shuai, who had disappeared for months after accusing a senior CCP official of sexual assault.
* **Cutting Taiwan’s Video Feed to Appease Beijing (December 13, 2021):** During the Summit for Democracy, Taiwan’s digital minister presented a map showing Taiwan in a different color than China. Minutes later, the White House [ordered](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/curious-case-map-disappearing-taiwan-minister-us-democracy-summit-2021-12-12/) her video feed to be cut and an onscreen disclaimer later appeared: “Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States government.” Apparently, the incident had caused panic among Biden officials afraid of angering the CCP. A State Department spokesperson later stated that cutting Tang's video feed was “an honest mistake” and happened after “confusion.”
* **Failing to Deter China’s “No-Limits Partnership” with Russia (February 4, 2022):** Just three weeks before Russia invades Ukraine, Beijing signed a “no-limits” partnership with Moscow, signaling support for Putin’s war effort. Since then, Russia’s trade with China has [hit](https://www.reuters.com/markets/china-russia-2023-trade-value-hits-record-high-240-bln-chinese-customs-2024-01-12/) a record $240 billion, with Chinese exports to Russia rising by more than 60 percent and China emerging as a major economic lifeline for Russia. The two nations have also held joint air patrols near South Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese airspace and Beijing has provided the Russian military with dual-use support.
* **Shutting Down An Anti-Espionage Program (February 23, 2022):** The Biden- Harris Administration [shut down](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/23/1082593735/justice-department-china-initiative) the China Initiative, a DOJ program launched in 2018 focused on “identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage.” DOJ leaders were apparently concerned that the program was stoking “anti-Asian bias.”
* **Failing to Enforce Iranian Oil Sanctions Against China (March 1, 2022):** Tanker tracking data reveals that the PRC is responsible for keeping the Iranian regime in business with record oil purchases exceeding a previous peak in 2016 when the trade was unsanctioned by the United States. In January 2022, Chinese imports exceeded 700,000 barrels per day while the Biden-Harris Administration refused to enforce sanctions and continued to pursue nuclear negotiations. By March 2024, Iranian petroleum exports to China [doubled](https://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/tanker-tracker) to 1.5 million barrels per day.
* **Discouraging Speaker Pelosi from Visiting Taiwan (August 3, 2022):** After Xi Jinping told President Biden not to allow Speaker Pelosi to travel to Taipei and that “those who play with fire will perish by it,” the White House [discouraged](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/03/biden-pelosi-taiwan-trip-beijing-00049625) her from visiting the island to avoid “provoking” the CCP. To her credit, Pelosi moved forward with the trip and reaffirmed “America’s unshakeable commitment to our allies and friends in the region.” The Biden-Harris Administration’s meddling in the CODEL showed its continued sensitivity to Beijing’s rhetorical resolve.
* **Muddling U.S. Policy on Taiwan Four Times (September 19, 2022):** For the fourth time in just over a year, President Biden publicly [asserted](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/biden-says-u-s-would-send-troops-to-defend-taiwan-from-chinese-invasion-for-fourth-time/) that American forces would defend Taipei against a PLA invasion–a clear departure from strategic ambiguity. As with similar statements in the past, it was walked back by White House officials who insisted no change in U.S. policy. The comment renewed public confusion about the Biden-Harris stance and raised alarm about the President’s cognitive state.
* **Chasing Elusive Climate Cooperation with the CCP (September 20, 2022):** In protest of Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the CCP suspended bilateral cooperation with the United States on climate. However, John Kerry [expressed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-21/kerry-sees-prospect-for-thaw-in-frozen-us-china-climate-talks?leadSource=uverify%20wall) hope that his Chinese counterpart would soon answer his emails again. The CCP’s move indicated their view that climate cooperation could be leveraged to deter pro-Taiwan activities by U.S. officials–a strategy that Kerry’s response seemed to vindicate.
* **Failing to Get the UN Human Rights Council to Even Debate China’s Genocide (October 6, 2022):** Despite the Biden-Harris Administration’s claims that “positive change \[were] within reach” with renewed U.S. participation on the Council, the UNHRC [voted down](https://x.com/PhilALynch/status/1578005613170376704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1578005613170376704%7Ctwgr%5E3f1134e718deb2b753f4d65baaadb093a3774e97%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fworld%2Fchina%2Fun-body-rejects-historic-debate-chinas-human-rights-record-2022-10-06%2F) a U.S.-led motion to hold a debate about China’s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The refusal of the Council to even discuss the CCP’s ongoing genocide showed how misguided it was for the Biden-Harris Administration rejoin the body with no precondition or serious reform efforts.
* **Publishing a Misguided National Security Strategy (October 12, 2022):** Almost two years after entering office, the Biden Administration finally [released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf) its NSS. Predictably, China was barely mentioned in its regional strategies, demonstrating the White House had no plan to challenge CCP influence around the world. The Europe and Western Hemisphere sections only included one cursory mention of China, while the Middle East and Africa sections omitted discussion of it entirely. Most disturbingly, the strategy’s publication was delayed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine–an indication that Moscow was not identified as a major U.S. threat in the original draft–and the final version did not even mention China’s support for Russia’s war effort.
* **Congressional Report Exposes PLA Modernization (November 29, 2022):** The Pentagon [stated](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF) that China aims to modernize its capabilities and improve its proficiencies across all warfare domains to “fight and win wars against a strong enemy, counter an intervention by a third party in a conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and project power globally.” These comments underscored Beijing’s intent to challenge the U.S. military and reduce international opposition to its designs on Taiwan.
* **PLA Fighter Jet Nearly Collides with U.S. Plane (December 21, 2022):** The Chinese pilot of a J-11 jet [performed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/politics/chinese-fighter-jet-intercepts-us-reconnaissance-aircraft/index.html#:~:text=On%20December%2021%2C%20a%20Chinese,said%20in%20a%20statement%20Thursday.) an unsafe maneuver within 20 feet of a U.S. Air Force RC-135 plane, forcing the American pilot to take “evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision.” In response to the incident, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that America’s “provocative and dangerous actions are the root cause of maritime security issues.”
* **China Increases Warplane Incursions Around Taiwan (2020 - 2022):** The PLA steadily increased pressure on Taiwan since 2020 through violations of the air defense identification zone near the island. Incursions by fighter jet and bomber sorties increased over 300% since 2020, rising from 380 incidents in 2020 to 960 incursions in 2021 and 1,727 in 2022.
* **Letting the Spy Balloon Traverse America (January 28-February 4, 2023):** For a full week, Biden and Harris allowed a high-altitude CCP surveillance balloon to fly across the entire continental United States, letting Beijing violate our airspace with impunity and gather intelligence on our military bases–a move even Democrats rebuked. The White House first denied the balloon’s existence before ensuring it had enough time to reach the eastern coastline. Providing cover for the CCP, President Biden later [reflected](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4055470-biden-on-chinese-spy-balloon-embarrassing/) that the balloon was “more embarrassing than it was intentional.” VP Harris responded to the espionage by [assuring](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2023/02/15/kamala-harris-chinese-spy-balloon-does-not-impact-us-china-relations/) Beijing that the Administration did not seek “conflict or confrontation” and their actions would not impact diplomacy with China. For his part, Sec. Blinken said the “chapter should be closed” so long as it doesn’t happen again.
* **Ignoring Congressional Inquiries into Kerry’s Climate Dealings with the CCP (February 2, 2023):** The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability [wrote](https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-probes-john-kerrys-secret-negotiations-as-special-presidential-envoy-for-climate/) multiple times to Kerry’s office requesting documentation and information regarding his activities. Despite engaging in activities that skirt congressional authority and threaten U.S. security under the pretense of climate advocacy, his office repeatedly refused to provide transparency about his activities, spending, and staffing with Congress.
* **Ordering State Not to Respond to Balloon Incident (February 6, 2023):** According to State Department officials, Sec. Blinken [directed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/06/the-price-of-blinkens-china-trip/) his team to back down on issuing human rights-related sanctions, exports controls, and other actions in response to China’s spy balloon incursion–rather than hold Beijing to account–to de-escalate tensions with the CCP.
* **China Attacks “U.S. Hegemony” (February 20, 2023):** In a 4,000-word diatribe, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs [attacked](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html) American foreign policy for “abuse of hegemony in the political, military, economic, financial, technological and cultural fields.” The CCP also decries the so-called “perils of the U.S. practices to world peace and stability and the well-being of all peoples.”
* **Watching China Aid Moscow (February 23, 2023):** According to leaked government documents, Beijing [provided](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/china-almost-certainly-gave-russia-dual-use-aid-blinken-says) weapons to Moscow, disguising them as civilian items–a revelation that offered further proof of the CCP’s efforts to prolong the war and strengthen Sino-Russian ties. The State Department has since raised concerns that Beijing is providing not only dual-use technologies to Russia but “very substantial” support, but the U.S. response has been minimal other than sanctioning a few Chinese firms and diplomatic hand-wringing.
* **Proposing 3% Real Cut to Military Budget, Slashing PDI (March 9, 2023):** In its FY24 budget request, the Biden Administration [called](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget/#:~:text=On%20March%209%2C%202023%2C%20the,billion%20more%20than%20FY%202022.) for a defense spending “increase” that did not even adjust for year-on-year inflation and pay raises, which would put U.S. military spending at its lowest level since the Second World War as a share of the economy and cut the Pentagon’s buying power. The PBR’s paltry $9.1 billion request for the DOD Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) also ignored the assessment of the combatant command in charge of the Indo-Pacific region, which indicated $15.4 billion was needed in FY24 to address the threat of China. Meanwhile, China increased its annual defense budget by a whopping 7.2%.
* **China Attacks “America’s Coercive Diplomacy” (May 18, 2023):** The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs [launched](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/xw/wjbxw/202405/t20240530_11343447.html) a 5,158-word tirade aiming “to expose the evil deeds of U.S. coercive diplomacy in the world and make the international community better understand the hegemonic and bullying nature of U.S. diplomacy.”
* **Refusing to Improve Taiwan’s Defenses (May 23, 2023):** After Congress passed the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act–which aimed to bolster Taiwan's defense through measures like presidential drawdown authority for immediate weapons transfer from U.S. stockpiles–the Biden-Harris Administration [refused](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/2735980/biden-administration-must-stop-breaking-congresss-new-taiwan-defense-law/) to adhere to key provisions of the law. It ignored a Foreign Military Financing grant program and failed to address the $20 billion backlog in arms sales, which may delay the arrival of weapons to Taiwan until 2029.
* **Downplaying the Tiananmen Square Anniversary (June 4, 2023):** Despite pledging to put human rights at the center of its foreign policy, the Biden State Department [sent](https://freebeacon.com/national-security/biden-diplomats-travel-to-beijing-to-thaw-relations-as-ccp-cracks-down-on-tiananmen-anniversary-protests/) diplomats to visit the CCP on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre–the same day the PRC sent tanks to brutally repress peaceful pro-democracy protesters and civilians in 1989. It also reduced the normal three paragraph annual memorial statement to a single paragraph.
* **Denying the CCP’s Cuba Spy Base (June 8, 2023):** After the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuba-to-host-secret-chinese-spy-base-focusing-on-u-s-b2fed0e0) that Beijing has installed a spy base just miles off the coast of Florida in neighboring Cuba, the White House categorically denied the story, with NSC Spokesman John Kirby described the story as “inaccurate.” Two days later, the White House admitted the story’s veracity but protested the challenge was inherited from the Trump Administration. One Biden official even stated the threat has been addressed through “diplomacy” and the PRC has been “slowed down.”
* **Greenlighting Chinese Cigarettes (June 10, 2023):** The FDA allowed Chinese- manufactured illegal e-cigarettes to remain on the market and accessible in U.S. liquor and convenience stores despite China’s manufacturing of fentanyl precursor chemicals and its [smuggling](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/investigations/investigation-findings-ccps-role-fentanyl-crisis) across the Southern Border. In 2022 alone, DEA seized more than 58 million fentanyl-laced pills and 13,000 pounds of fentanyl powder,” more than enough to kill everyone in the United States and most of it manufactured in China.
* **Rewarding China With a Diplomatic Pilgrimage (June 18, 2023):** On the heels of the espionage balloon incident, revelations of a CCP spy base in Cuba, and reports that PLA hackers were hiding malicious computer code inside U.S. military base networks, Sec. Blinken [spent](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/world/asia/blinken-xi-china.html) eleven hours in talks with Beijing officials. The trip did not lead to accountability for China’s export of fentanyl precursor chemicals, a resumption of the much-touted military-to-military dialogue, or address China’s economic coercion, IP theft, and other destabilizing trade activities. The Biden-Harris Administration may have declined to release the FBI spy balloon probe results to secure a meeting.
* **Requesting China’s “Help” on Fentanyl Cooperation (June 19, 2023):** After meeting with Xi and others in China, Sec. Blinken insisted the CCP had [agreed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/18/china/blinken-china-visit-wang-yi-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html) to set up “a working group or joint effort” to combat fentanyl trafficking. But China promptly lashed out at America's “chronic problem of drug abuse," making clear they gaslit him all along and that hopes for cooperation were misplaced.
* **Ignoring Chinese Warnings on Concessions (July 19, 2023):** After a much- anticipated visit to Beijing for climate talks, John Kerry claimed the visit was successful because its goal was to “unstick” talks. However, the visit did not yield any tangible outcomes. Xi Jinping’s speech that same week [indicated](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/19/china/china-xi-carbon-climate-kerry-intl-hnk/index.html) that Beijing would keep increasing its carbon emissions through 2030 and that China’s climate goals would never be determined “under the sway of others.” Despite Kerry insisting that “climate should be free standing” as a diplomatic issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also said that climate “cannot be separated from the overall environment of Sino-U.S. relations” – a clear message that China will link its climate cooperation to concessions on economics and security. During the meeting, Kerry gently expressed concerns about new coal coming online in China. How did China respond? By completely disregarding his comments and constructing more coal-fired power plants in 2024.
* **Refusing to Blame China for Hacking U.S. Officials (July 20, 2023):** A cyber- espionage attack successfully accessed the email accounts of Commerce Sec. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns, and senior officials working on East Asian and Pacific affairs such as Daniel Kritenbrink. Weeks later, it was revealed that the Chinese hackers [stole](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/us/politics/chinese-hackers-state-department.html#:~:text=Chinese%20hackers%20who%20gained%20access,received%20on%20the%20matter%20Wednesday.) 60,000 State Department emails containing significant sensitive information. But the Biden Administration refused to formally blame China for the hack despite Microsoft’s assessment linking it to a Chinese hacking group.
* **Chinese Hackers Embed Malware in U.S. Networks (July 29, 2023):** Hackers likely working for the PLA [inserted](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/us/politics/china-malware-us-military-bases-taiwan.html) malicious code to cut off America’s power grids, communications systems, and water supplies to U.S. military bases. The revelations raised alarm that the CCP could disrupt U.S. operations during a conflict and give China the ability to interrupt military deployments or resupply operations. Officials acknowledged the Biden-Harris Administration did not realize the extent of the code’s presence. The White House’s statement did not even reference China as the culprit.
* **China Launches Navy Patrol Near Alaska (August 6, 2023):** China and Russia [conducted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-and-china-sent-large-naval-patrol-near-alaska-127de28b) a joint operation off the coast of Alaska in what was the largest such flotilla to approach American shores. Eleven Chinese and Russian ships steamed close to the Aleutian Islands in the highly provocative move.
* **Announcing Weak Investment Restrictions (August 9, 2023):** The White House [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/09/us/politics/biden-ban-china-investment.html) long-awaited restrictions on outbound U.S. investment in certain Chinese companies. However, lawmakers on Capitol Hill pointed out the measures are ridden with loopholes, ignored the dual-use nature of important technologies, and failed to include critical industries for Beijing. By the Treasury Department’s own admission, the executive order was a “narrowly targeted action.”
* **Proposing An EPA Chemicals Rule Hurting the Semiconductor Industry (August 11, 2023):** The Biden-Harris EPA [proposed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/semiconductor-makers-call-epa-chemicals-proposal-catastrophic) a rule to tighten uses of crucial chemicals used in low volumes by the semiconductor industry. Lawmakers [raised](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_regan.pdf) alarm about the proposal, which would make it nearly impossible to onshore semiconductor manufacturing and jeopardize over 277,000 U.S. jobs–all while enhancing China’s competitive advantage in semiconductors.
* **Rewarding Chinese Cyber-Espionage with a Visit (August 27, 2023):** After being hacked by Chinese actors, Sec. Raimondo [rewarded](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/08/us-secretary-commerce-gina-raimondo-travel-peoples-republic-china) the CCP with a visit, becoming the first Commerce secretary to visit China in five years. While acknowledging that “they did hack me, which was unappreciated,” she papered over the incident by describing relations as “complicated.” Although she did not achieve progress on any trade matter, at least she [visited](https://www.reuters.com/world/disney-diplomacy-us-commerce-secretary-visits-china-theme-park-2023-08-30/) Shanghai Disneyland on the taxpayer's dime!
* **The CCP Restricts Exports of Key Critical Minerals (October 20, 2023):** China announced new export restrictions on graphite, following similar action for gallium and germanium exports over the summer. Graphite is a key component of EV batteries and nuclear reactors while gallium and germanium are important for semiconductor production. The move showed Beijing’s ability to disrupt U.S. supply chains amid delays in White House efforts to [boost](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/22/fact-sheet-securing-a-made-in-america-supply-chain-for-critical-minerals/) their domestic production.
* **Failing to Stop China’s IP Theft (October 22, 2023):** Five Eyes intelligence leaders including FBI Director Christopher Wray [warned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-technology-theft-major-threat-fbi-head-warns-60-minutes/) that China was continuing to steal U.S. intellectual property, including U.S. defense-related technology, at an alarming rate. The Biden-Harris Administration has prompted concerns about lax enforcement actions against Chinese companies and hackers and the White House’s failure to adequately escalate penalties, hold Chinese entities accountable for their illegal activities, or retaliate effectively. Some estimates have [indicated](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/6.15.2023-letter-to-doj-china-select-cmte.-on-small-business.pdf) Chinese IP theft has cost the U.S. economy up to $600 billion annually.
* **Declaring a Premature Victory on Fentanyl (November 16, 2023):** The White House published a fact sheet stating that the CCP would crack down on fentanyl producers, but a subsequent Washington Post story [debunked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/20/china-fentanyl-mexico-us/) that narrative, noting that “seven months later, those same sellers say it’s business as usual.” Chinese companies described the situation in China as “more relaxed,” reportedly exporting precursors under labels like “soap powder.” Biden and Harris’ “tough dialogues” with China did nothing to stop hundreds of Americans from getting killed every single day.
* **Legitimizing a CCP Front Group (December 8, 2023):** A top staffer of Climate Envoy John Kerry [participated](https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/02/john-kerry-staffer-spoke-at-climate-meeting-alongside-ccp-front-group/) in a meeting with the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), a nonprofit the IC has determined is working to co-opt U.S. government officials. The climate meeting occurred on the sidelines of the annual UN climate conference in Dubai. Sec. Pompeo had warned government officials for years that CPAFFC is part of the CCP’s influence campaign.
* **IC Confirms China Interfered in Midterm Elections (December 18, 2023):** An intelligence assessment [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/aggressive-china-tried-influence-2022-midterms-us-intelligence-report-rcna130366) that China attempted to shape the outcome of specific races in the 2022 midterm elections, supporting candidates viewed as “pro-China.” This marked a more aggressive approach by the CCP to exploit U.S. societal divisions and sway U.S. policy in its favor. The report also highlighted that since 2020, Chinese senior leaders had intensified efforts to influence U.S. public opinion, believing that midterm elections faced less scrutiny and that the Biden-Harris Administration would not retaliate as strongly as feared during the 2020 presidential race.
* **Being Lectured by Xi Jinping on Taiwan (December 20, 2023):** Sources confirmed that Xi bluntly [informed](https://abcnews.go.com/International/xi-warns-biden-china-plans-back-taiwan/story?id=105815520) Biden–at a diplomatic summit focused on reducing tensions– that China will reunify with Taiwan, by force if necessary. Nonetheless, the Biden-Harris Administration touted the meeting as a success in thawing relations.
* **Letting Thousands of Chinese Migrants Cross the Border (February 4, 2024):** On “60 Minutes,” CBS [exposes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-border-mexico-chinese-migrants-60-minutes/) how Biden-Harris policies allowed a record number of Chinese citizens to cross the Southern Border. In 2023, Chinese nationals became the fastest-growing group crossing the border and some 37,000 Chinese citizens were apprehended illegally doing so, per CBP data–50 times more than two years earlier.
* **Biden’s Budget Request Barely Keeps Up with Inflation (March 11, 2024):** Once adjusting for inflation, President Biden’s requested military budget of $849.8 billion for this fiscal year [proposed](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3703410/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2025-defense-budget/) a real increase of just 0.49% from last year’s enacted level. This “increase” barely keeps pace with year-over-year inflation of 2.5% and fails to increase the Pentagon’s buying power, reflecting wishful thinking that we can keep pace with threats without funding our defense apparatus to do so.
* **Literally Bowing to the CCP (April 8, 2024):** During Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen’s meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, she [bowed](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-big-error-bowing-china-weakens-power-wilbur-ross-warns) three times to him before continuing the Administration’s apology campaign. Premier Li Qiang put her on notice about US efforts to "politicize" economic and trade issues and “overstretch the concept of national security." Despite this, she insisted “it is undeniable that the US-China relationship is on stronger footing today.” She also touted a new channel for CCP officials to raise their concerns over U.S. actions.
* **Getting Played by the CCP on Fentanyl Cooperation (April 16, 2024):** Despite the Biden-Harris Administration’s prior claims that China agreed to crack down on fentanyl exports that killed over 74,000 Americans in 2023, the House Select Committee on China [released](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/The%20CCP%27s%20Role%20in%20the%20Fentanyl%20Crisis%204.16.24%20%281%29.pdf) a report uncovering evidence that the CCP directly subsidizes America’s fentanyl crisis. Beijing supports programs to reward companies with financial incentives for exporting fentanyl and other drugs to the United States, including with tax breaks and grants to their manufacturers. According to the report, companies in China produce nearly all illicit fentanyl precursors–the key ingredients driving fentanyl trade globally.
* **Alienating Japan and India as Indo-Pacific Partners (May 2, 2024):** At a fundraising event for his now-defunct campaign, President Biden [called](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-india-japan-china-russia-immigration-economy-74a50301fac4f48fd5e5a4cc9b1bb3ff) Japan and India “xenophobic” countries, lumping them in with adversaries China and Russia in an effort to explain their economic circumstances. While NSC Spokesman John Kirby did his best to paper over the comments, Biden’s remark confused everyone on why he would antagonize two of America’s most critical regional partners for the China challenge.
* **Presiding Over Record CCP Infiltration in the Americas (July 4, 2024):** Over the last 3.5 years, the CCP [expanded](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/07/04/chinas-presence-in-latin-america-has-expanded-dramatically) its Latin America ties with “debt-trap diplomacy” and via Huawei’s 5G infrastructure projects, e-commerce platforms, and the BRI. CCP- owned enterprises deepened relations with Latin companies in strategic sectors such as telecommunications, mining, and materials. For its part, the PLA [grew](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri) ties with Latin militaries, enhancing intelligence gathering capabilities and investing in dual-use commercial facilities. Adoption of Chinese surveillance programs and data technologies have also increased at the same time that Beijing has increased its stranglehold on rare earth elements with Lithium Triangle investments. It remains unclear what the White House’s “Build Back Better World” agenda has done to seriously counter these advances.
* **Selecting China Apologist Tim Walz as VP (August 6, 2024):** Walz’s views toward the CCP are way outside the mainstream consensus. He has [called](https://x.com/michaelsobolik/status/1820821861648769175) for deepening U.S. economic engagement with Beijing despite its rights abuses, [stated](https://x.com/MAGAIncWarRoom/status/1820823234951999622) that he “totally disagree\[s]” that America should necessarily view China as an “an adversarial relationship,” and called for building a “solid, lasting partnership with China.” Walz downplayed concerns about the CCP’s authoritarianism, [described](https://archive.mpr.org/stories/2007/04/13/us-representative-tim-walz-delivers-foreign-policy-speech-at-university-of-minnesota) fears of Beijing as full of “hyperbole,” called China “amazing” and even honeymooned there. His behavior raises concerns that the CCP could gain a major advocate in the White House.
* **China Applies Antimony Export Restrictions (August 14, 2024):** The CCP [announced](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/) it would place export restrictions on antimony, a critical mineral used in the U.S. defense sector. Antimony has many military applications, including for armor- piercing ammunition, night vision goggles, infrared sensors, and bullets as well as electronics such as semiconductors, cables, and batteries. However, America relies on China for nearly two-thirds of its antimony imports. That has not stopped the Biden- Harris Administration from blocking antimony mining to increase domestic production despite clear interest from the Defense Department and Export-Import Bank.
* **Prioritizing Climate Over China in the DNC Platform (August 19, 2024):** The new Democratic platform [states](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-democratic-party-platform) plainly that “there is nothing more important than addressing the climate crisis,” showing that progressives view the CCP as a secondary security threat. The platform also praises President Biden’s decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, which was projected to reduce global temperatures in 2100 by a mere 0.17 degrees Celsius while costing the United States trillions of dollars in lost GDP and millions of jobs. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping publicly [disregards](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/19/climate-change-heat-wave-china/) China’s climate pledges.
* **Releasing a Platform with No Mention of Deterring China (August 19, 2024):** Democrats also managed to out-do their 2020 platform on China–which [included](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2020-democratic-party-platform) gems like “the China challenge is not primarily a military one,” we shouldn’t fall for “the trap of a new Cold War,” and America shouldn’t “exaggerate China’s weight.” The 2024 platform [touts](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) Biden’s “tough but smart” China strategy and discusses the need to “manage” our “most consequential strategic competitor” with no clear reference to deterring the CCP. We all know this is a euphemism for accommodation and appeasing Beijing. Does anyone actually think Harris would protect America against China?
* **Failing to Identify China as America’s Greatest Adversary (October 8, 2024):** During her “60 Minutes” interview, Harris was [asked](https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/us-news/harris-brands-iran-not-china-americas-no-1-adversary/) which country she considers the top U.S. adversary. Defying both the Pentagon and the Democratic Party’s own platform, she said the “obvious” answer was Iran. The response baffled observers–both because she did not acknowledge that Communist China is far and away the more serious U.S. national security threat and because she has spent years helping appease Tehran with sanctions relief, ransom payments, and efforts to protect its proxies from retaliation.
