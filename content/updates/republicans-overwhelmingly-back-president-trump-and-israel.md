This week, critics have been out in force [attacking](https://www.yahoo.com/news/tucker-carlson-blasts-trump-being-040325583.html) President Trump for standing with Israel and considering a military strike to stop Iran from going nuclear.  The only problem?  They don’t [represent](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/trump-interview-iran-israel/683192/) the America First movement – and the overwhelming majority of conservatives [disagree](https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/maga-voters-overwhelmingly-support-us-strikes-on-iranian-military-poll/) with their takes.

Here’s what Republicans in Congress - elected by actual Republican voters - are saying:

**[Senate Majority Leader John Thune:](https://x.com/LeaderJohnThune/status/1934279015352946805)** “President Trump is all about trying to keep America out of wars and to try to find a path toward peaceful outcomes and peaceful solutions. He’s tried to do that with Iran. Iran has grown, I think, increasingly defiant of late in these talks, these discussions. But what this comes down to is action taken by Israel to defend themselves and their people. They view Iran’s nuclear capability, as do we, as a non-starter.”

**[House Speaker Mike Johnson](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1933487567191625805):** “Israel and the United States have been united, including in our shared insistence that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon. President Trump and his Administration have worked tirelessly to ensure that outcome. Unfortunately, Iran has refused to agree and even declared yesterday its intent to build a new enrichment facility. Israel decided it needed to take action to defend itself. They were clearly within their right to do so. Iran will face grave consequences if it responds by unjustifiably targeting U.S. interests.”

**[House Majority Leader Steve Scalise:](https://x.com/SteveScalise/status/1933345873318035515)** “Iran has refused to dismantle its nuclear program, which puts America at risk and poses an existential threat to Israel. Tonight Israel is taking action to defend itself, and we stand with Israel. Our prayers are with them and all American personnel in the region.”

**[SASC Chairman Senator Roger Wicker:](https://x.com/SenatorWicker/status/1933370594470371768)** “Tonight, we stand firmly alongside Israel and its unilateral preemptive strike against Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s sprint to become a nuclear threat to America and our allies, while leading the world in proliferating terrorism, is the cause of this conflict. The single worst decision Iran could make now is to target American service members.”

**[SFRC Chairman Senator Jim Risch:](https://x.com/SenatorRisch/status/1933348361891123321)** “We stand with Israel tonight and pray for the safety of its people and the success of this unilateral, defensive action. I am also praying for the brave U.S. service members in the Middle East who keep America safe—Iran would be foolish to attack the United States.”

**[HASC Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers:](https://x.com/HASCRepublicans/status/1933353825437413494)** “As events unfold tonight in the Middle East, one thing is clear: Iran is the aggressor. Its pursuit of a nuclear weapon is an existential threat that will not be tolerated. The U.S. was not involved in the strikes, but our forces stand ready to defend themselves and our ally Israel. Any Iranian attack on U.S. forces would be a grave miscalculation.”

**[HFAC Chairman Rep. Brian Mast:](https://x.com/HouseForeignGOP/status/1933566772768022974)** “President Trump has always been very clear. The United States of America does not have permanent enemies and it’s never too late to reach out and have diplomacy. He has been doing this right up until the last second through his envoys and I think he maintains that position. He’s been very clear as well, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.”

**[Senator Lindsey Graham:](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1934789865943580805)** “I think Iran has allowed themselves to be fooled into thinking they could manipulate Trump. Same old tactics with the wrong guy when it comes to Trump. To all those who voted for President Trump and got him in office, God bless you. He’s the right guy at the right time.”

**[Senator Tom Cotton:](https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1933533946177806556)** “I commend President Trump for his consistent support for Israel and opposition to Iran’s nuclear program. He gave Iran “chance after chance” for a peaceful deal, as he said this morning and Iran refused. He’s now willing to give them another chance. I urge the ayatollahs to immediately accept President Trump’s terms. It should be clear now that America and Israel mean business.”

**[Senator James Lankford:](https://x.com/SenatorLankford/status/1933334633455751588)** “The Iranian regime has threatened the world, advanced their nuclear weapon capacity and rejected negotiated options. When the Iranian regime chants 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America,' we should believe they mean it. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I’m standing with Israel, praying for peace.”

**[Senator Joni Ernst:](https://x.com/SenJoniErnst/status/1933958659614060629)** “I want to say that there is hope. And God bless President Trump for doing what he is doing. Our president is strong, and he has tried to bring peace not just to the Middle East but to the world as well, and that should always be the goal. And we know that the president will continue to push for that. Now, will Iran come to the table? That's yet to be seen.”

**[Senator Pete Ricketts:](https://x.com/SenatorRicketts/status/1935097623381426355)** “Iran is a very dangerous opponent. America needs to make sure we’re supporting Israel. We shouldn’t do anything to undermine the President as he tries to negotiate the ending of Iran’s nuclear program.”

**[Senator Dan Sullivan:](https://x.com/SenDanSullivan/status/1933516389702111724)** “Iran has had more than a decade to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions. The Trump administration has gone the extra distance by pursuing a diplomatic solution. Iran’s response: cheating and hiding its nuclear weapons program; sprinting toward a bomb; and trying to assassinate senior American officials, including President Trump.”

**[Senator Dave McCormick:](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/1933356356016230526)** “We are praying for the success of Israel’s mission to thwart the world’s largest state sponsor of terror and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran has been a destabilizing threat to security in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and around the world, and has the blood of Americans on its hands. I am grateful to President Trump and his team for trying to achieve this peacefully.”

**[Senator Katie Britt:](https://x.com/SenKatieBritt/status/1933563706895466932)** “Thank you, President Trump. Peace through strength is imperative to our national security and security across the globe. America stands firmly with our great ally, Israel, and I remain steadfast in my support for the complete dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear program.”

**[Senator Ted Cruz](https://x.com/SenTedCruz/status/1934779322197241892):** “I stand unequivocally with President Trump. President Trump has said Iran will not get a nuclear weapon and we will do whatever is necessary. That means we stand unequivocally with the state of Israel. That is where America is, it is where I am, and it’s the right place to be for the interest of the United States of America.” 

**[Senator Bill Hagerty](https://x.com/SenatorHagerty/status/1935002999757373754):** “I think President Trump has been very clear, he's not for these forever wars, they go on ad infinitum. At the same time, he's also been very clear that we stand with Israel. I think most people in America feel the same way”

**[Senator John Curtis:](https://x.com/SenMcCormickPA/status/1933356356016230526)** “The United States must stand firmly with Israel and remain committed to long-term peace and stability in the region. I pray for the safety of our American service members stationed in the Middle East, and for the Israeli and Iranian people who suffer because of the Ayatollah’s regime.”

**[Senator Steve Daines:](https://x.com/SteveDaines/status/1935009468590207209)** “President Trump is exactly right. The time for discussions is over. The Iranians have had a chance to come up with a deal—they haven’t. It is time to take out the nuclear capabilities.”

**[Senator Markwayne Mullin:](https://x.com/SenMullin/status/1935008663703597445)** “There is nobody who wants peace more than Donald Trump. Everything he does is for the safety, security, and prosperity of the American people.”

**[Rep. Elise Stefanik:](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1935363918840447380)** “President Trump has been very clear: Iran must never have a nuclear weapon. I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and Israel's right to defend itself against the evil regime in Iran.”

**[Rep. Dan Crenshaw:](https://x.com/RepDanCrenshaw/status/1934797941954187464)** “The President is right- Iran, a country whose motto is “Death to America”cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Full stop. That is peace through strength. That is America First.President Trump is doing EXACTLY what he should be doing: stating a clear red line (and a very reasonable one), and leaving all options on the table to deal with it.”

**[Rep. Joe Wilson:](https://x.com/RepJoeWilson/status/1932605399502631041)** “President Trump knows that peace is achieved through strength, not surrender. I am grateful that the President has prioritized nuclear modernization for deterrence. Enemies of America and freedom around the world are fueled by fear and hesitation.”

**[Rep. Pat Fallon:](https://x.com/RepPatFallon/status/1934993969655492788)** “President Trump has shown he has the right instincts on foreign policy to keep Americans safe and advance US interests.He's neither a hawk nor an isolationist. He understands nuance and the situation at hand. His successful embrace of "peace through strength" makes this clear.”

**[Rep. Chip Roy:](https://x.com/RepChipRoy/status/1933616408576839867)** “I stand with President Trump as we will continue to support our friend and ally, Israel, as it rightfully takes action to defend itself, and I am unequivocal in my belief that denying Iran nuclear capability is firmly in the national security interest of the United States”

**[Rep. Greg Staube:](https://x.com/RepGregSteube/status/1933497465077985300)** “Trump has been abundantly clear: we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, and I agree completely that should be US policy. Iran needs to strike a deal with him now. Stop the destruction. Dismantle the nuclear program. Do it before it’s too late.”

**[Rep. Kat Cammack:](https://x.com/Kat_Cammack/status/1933600716142051764)** “Our country, led by President Trump, has and will continue to play an important role pushing for a resolution. I am confident that under his leadership, we will continue to take the necessary precautions to protect American personnel in the region.”

**[Rep. Bill Huizenga:](https://x.com/RepHuizenga/status/1933359590709866519)** “I am thankful we have a Commander in Chief that will defend U.S. Forces abroad. It has long been untenable for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. I pray for a swift resolution to this conflict as Israel defends its sovereignty.”

**[Rep. Tom Emmer:](https://x.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1933356935757127975)** “Three things are true tonight: Iran is the aggressor, Israel is defending its people — and has every right to, It would be a grave miscalculation to test our U.S. forces.”

**[Rep. Kevin Hern:](https://x.com/repkevinhern/status/1933505919838503382)** “Iran can never become a nuclear power - they’re a threat to every freedom-loving person on this planet. God bless America, God bless Israel.”

**[Rep. Rob Bresnahan:](https://x.com/RepBresnahan/status/1933534033452958134)** “The United States will continue to stand with our strongest and only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, and its people. The world cannot let Iran, the leading state-sponsor or terrorism, access nuclear weapons.”

**[Rep. Jim Jordan:](https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1933495486406594578)** “Israel has every right to defend itself. God Bless our great ally. Iran should not retaliate against American forces.”

**[Rep. John Moolenaar:](https://x.com/RepMoolenaar/status/1933356716269150483)** “Israel has every right to defend itself against those who wish to destroy it. A nuclear Iran poses a critical threat to the United States and our allies, and puts American military personnel in the Middle East at risk. I stand with Israel as it confronts this threat, and it would be a mistake for the Iranian regime to target American servicemembers in retaliation.”

**[Rep. August Pfluger:](https://x.com/RepPfluger/status/1934786901665268089)** “We must support Israel 100%. Iranian leaders have fomented chaos, sponsored terrorism, and lied to the world for decades…and they want to destroy America.I will always support Israel.  We must not allow Iran to have a nuclear capability. Period.”

Fringe voices will attack President Trump for supporting our closest ally and confronting a nuclear Iran, but conservatives know weakness only fuels our enemies.  **The America First movement knows exactly where it stands: with U.S. leadership and against a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic of Iran.**
