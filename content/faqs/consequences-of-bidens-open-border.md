* Over 100,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended at the southern border in both 2021, 2022, and the fiscal year 2023 to-date. By comparison, only 23,803 unaccompanied children were encountered in 2020.
* As just one sad example, a 4-year-old drowned in the Rio Grande attempting to swim across with his mother in March 2022. Sadly, there are likely hundreds of such cases.
* In February 2023, Border Agents found a 5-month-old baby abandoned by his mother and over 100 children dropped off by human smugglers wandering in the desert
