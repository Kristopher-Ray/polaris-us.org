* The U.S. military is facing a major recruitment crisis, with most branches of the armed forces unable to meet their enlistment goals. The Army missed its FY2023 goal by 10 percent after falling short of its FY2022 goal by a whopping 15,000 soldiers (25 percent)— its toughest recruiting year since the all-volunteer force began. The Navy also fell short of its sailor and officer objectives by 7,450 recruits, and the Air Force missed its Reserve and Guard numbers by over 30 percent and experienced its worst recruiting outcome since 1999. In total, the military missed its FY2023 recruitment goals by about 41,000 recruits.
* In 2023, only 9 percent of Americans ages 16-21 said they would consider military service. That is down from 13 percent prior to the pandemic.
* Health constraints and a deficiency of basic qualifications are major causes. Only 23 percent of American youth have the physical, mental, and moral competencies to join the U.S. military without receiving a waiver of some kind. Obesity, educational deficiencies, mental health issues, and criminal records disqualify 77 percent of American youth, constricting our recruitment pool.
* Declining patriotism— which is strongly correlated with disinterest in military service—is also to blame. Over the past 25 years, the percentage of Americans who say that patriotism is a “very important” value in their life has declined by 32 percent. The statistics are particularly acute among young white Democrats.

* The percentage of military and veteran families who would recommend military life has dropped from three quarters to less than two thirds in three years. With nearly 80 percent of recruits having relatives who served, this should alarm military recruiters.
* There are no easy fixes here, but we certainly know what doesn’t work: woke policies that make a bad problem worse by alienating potential recruits who don’t want to put up with progressive politics.
