* Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terrorist group in Lebanon, stockpiles and shoots rockets and missiles at Israel. Its operatives often wage attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers.
* The Iranian regime calls for the complete destruction of Israel while pursuing a nuclear program and holding the largest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East.
* Since the 1980s, America has supported the U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation, where our countries share the most advanced defense technologies with each other.
* The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) developed a world-class, high-technology, anti-rocket system in 2011, known as The Iron Dome. The systems can simultaneously shoot down over 90 percent of short-range rockets fired at populations centers, saving countless civilian lives.
* The Iron Dome combines tracking radar, AI technology, and advanced missiles which detects, tracks, fires, and destroys incoming rockets and missiles.
* The Iron Dome has proved effective protecting the lives of the nearly 10 million Jews, Christians, and Muslims who live in Israel, though it does not come without cost.
* For every $300-$800 rocket that radical Islamists fire at Israeli civilians, Israel spends around $40,000 shooting it down.
* Israel is currently testing laser technology as an addition to the Iron Dome. High frequency lasers have shown signs of destroying rockets at a far cheaper cost than missiles.
* In May 2021, Hamas waged war against Israel and its civilians, indiscriminately firing over 4,500 rockets into Israel’s heavily populated cities. The Iron Dome stopped almost all the rockets, and only 10 Israeli civilians were killed in the attacks. It has provided similar security since October 7 having blocked thousands of Hamas and Hezbollah rockets.
* The United States acknowledges Israel’s deepening threats and proudly supports the IDF in their fight against inhumane terrorists that attack Israel any chance they the get. In exchange, the United States sustains a deep and longstanding partnership with the only democracy in the Middle East, develops world-class military technology, and keeps a foothold in a region and intelligence on terror groups plotting harm against Americans.
