* Two decades ago, the PLA was a low-technology, ground-centric force that steadily operated below the United States’ military across every metric, following Deng’s direction to modernize the economy and agriculture first. 
* Since then, the CCP has steadily modeled itself after the US military, leveraging access to our military technology to transform the PLA from a bloated, poorly funded force into a high-tech “informationized” force capable of synchronizing air, naval, ground, and high-tech cyber forces. The CCP excels in missile technology and has shaped their force structure specifically to counter U.S. military power. 
* In 2021, the Pentagon revealed that China is equal to or exceeds the United States in shipbuilding, land-based ballistic missiles, and integrated air defense systems.
*  China’s strategy is based on countering specific U.S. advantages, particularly our more advanced air and maritime capabilities. In direct conflict, China would target U.S. aircraft carriers in an attempt to handicap the United States’ strongest advantage. 
* The PLA’s first priority is domestic control; it exists to keep the CCP in power. After that, its focus is forced capture of Taiwan, with the goal of preventing US intervention (A2AD). Recent positive commitments from Japan have complicated the PLA’s plans.
