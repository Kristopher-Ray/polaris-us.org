* Over 85 percent of all illegal border crossers were turned back to Mexico. The Trump Administration built over 458 miles of border wall that Biden instantly stopped construction on when he took office.
* Building the wall helped keep crime, drugs, cartels, and illegal immigrants from invading our country. Equally important, the Trump Administration implemented targeted and successful policies that deterred people from getting to our border in the first place.
* When people think that they can illegally enter and stay in the United States without consequence, they will come. Far too many foreign citizens correctly believe that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will let them in—and it’s caused a crisis at our border.
* Recent estimates say up to 17 million illegal immigrants live in the United States—more than the entire population of New York state.
* The Trump Administration stemmed the flow of illegal immigrants arriving at the border through two important policies. First, through the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), known as the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, the United States made illegal border crossers wait in Mexico before they were entitled to an immigration hearing. Most hearings take years to adjudicate, previously leaving illegal immigrants free to live in the United States.
* The other tool, known as Asylum Cooperative Agreements (ACAs), made would-be migrants traversing through Central America to first claim asylum in a safe neighboring country and allowed the United States to send asylum claimants at the overwhelmed Southern Border to safe third country for processing.
