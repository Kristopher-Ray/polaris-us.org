**Hundreds of Thousands of Americans Are Dying Because of the Disaster at Our Southern Border** 

* Nearly six million illegal immigrants have been caught attempting to cross the border since Biden took office. This is more than the population of South Carolina- and does not include those who were not apprehended at all.
* Over 1,500,000 illegal aliens detected but not captured at the border have disappeared into the United States – more than the whole population of New Hampshire.
*  Illicit drugs are flowing into the country at an alarming rate, with [14,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics) and over [175,000 pounds](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics) of methamphetamine seized at the southern border in 2022 alone. In both 2021 and 2022, over 100,000 Americans died from drug and opioid- related overdoses, predominantly from fentanyl.
* This is an unprecedented national crisis occurring because Democrats refuse to protect our southern border.
