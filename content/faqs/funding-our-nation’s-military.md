**The Facts About U.S. Defense Spending**

* National defense has been declining as a share of federal spending for the last 35 years, falling from 28.1 percent in 1987 to 13 percent in FY2024.
* Our federal government currently spends 2.9 percent of total GDP on our military. This means that only 2.9 percent of all U.S. economic output goes to our defense community to protect our families and ensure our world is stable for American business.

**President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2024 Defense Budget**

* President’s Biden FY2025 defense budget proposes over a real 10% cut from the level authorized by Congress in FY2024 once inflation is taken into account.
* President Biden’s proposed defense budget is built on wishful thinking that the United States can keep pace with growing and evolving threats without giving our defense apparatus the funding to do so.
* Despite claims that the White House’s FY2025 budget request would represent the “largest Pentagon budget in U.S. history,” it is actually cutting the Pentagon’s buying power. That’s not record defense spending.
* The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) understands the reality of our rivalry, which is why it has increased their military’s defense budget to over 7.2 percent. They are building ships faster than us and expanding their nuclear capabilities at a rapid pace.
* For their part, neither Russia, Iran, nor North Korea are showing any signs of restraint, and this proposed budget would give our military less to counter their threats.

**This budget reflects the worst tendencies of bureaucratic inertia: refusing to evolve and adapt to meet our global threats.**
