* Increasing funding for Border Patrol staffing, recruitment, and retention. In fact, in 2022, the Biden Administration’s anti-law enforcement actions and rhetoric have\
  likely driven 1,100 CBP agents to leave their job.
* Reinstating the Remain in Mexico policy that keeps immigrants seeking asylum in Mexico while their application applications are processed.
* Renegotiating the Asylum Cooperative Agreements (ACAs) with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, which would make migrants from these countries seek refuge within their own region instead of coming to the United States. The ACAs also allow the U.S. to send migrants to a safe neighboring country to claim asylum if caught at the U.S. border. President Biden terminated these agreements two weeks after entering office.
* Providing funding to finish construction of the Border Wall. While the Trump Administration built 458 miles of wall, funding was previously allocated for 738 miles that was immediately cancelled by Joe Biden.
* Millions of illegal immigrants have been caught attempting to cross the border since Biden took office, and 10,000 crossed daily in anticipation of the end of Title 42. Hundreds of thousands of these illegal aliens captured at the border have disappeared into our country’s interior. Meanwhile, the number of Chinese migrants crossing the Southern border has soared from 681 in 2021 to 37,439 last year.
* Illicit drugs are flowing into the country at an alarming rate, with thousands of pounds of deadly fentanyl and methamphetamine seized at the southern border on a regular basis. Last year alone, California National Guard-supported counter-drug operations seized a record 62,000 pounds of fentanyl. Since the start of Operation Lone Star, Texas has seized over 481 million lethal doses of fentanyl—enough to kill every man, woman, and child in the United States and Mexico. This is an unprecedented national crisis occurring because Democrats refuse to protect our southern border.
