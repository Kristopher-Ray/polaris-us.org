* **March 9, 2022**: U.S. rejects Poland's offer to give it Russian-made fighter jets for Ukraine, claiming it could provoke Russia (which had just started a land war in Europe).
* **March 10, 2022**: The United States won’t give the Patriot air defense system to Ukraine, claiming it may provoke Russia (which had bombed a maternity hospital killing hundreds of children, mothers, and doctors the day before).
* **May 18, 2022**: Biden rules out giving Ukraine Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) that can strike into Russia because it doesn’t want to provoke Russia (which had been bombarding apartments and other civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv).
* **May 31, 2022**: Biden finally agrees to give Ukraine MLRS, but only if Ukraine promises not to fire them inside Russia.
* **June 15, 2022**: Biden finally agrees to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, which will take several months to reach Ukraine. If the Harpoon missiles had been in Ukraine before the war (or even at the start of the war) they could have been used to deny Russian naval access and dominance.
* **August 9, 2022**: Biden refuses to send ATACMS munition that Ukraine has requested, because the administration is concerned it would provoke Russia (which had recently struck residential buildings, a supermarket, and pharmacy in Mykolaiv).
* **September 16, 2022**: Biden administration holds off Ukrainian request for more long-range missiles for fear of provoking Russia (which slaughtered tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians without provocation).

* **October 10, 2022**: Biden finally agrees to give Ukraine advanced air- defense systems after the Russians strike Kyiv with several missiles. The systems will take two months to arrive. If they had been sent two months earlier, they could have intercepted missiles.
* **November 29, 2022**: Eight months after saying it couldn’t provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, the Pentagon is considering sending Patriot batteries to Ukraine.
* **December 21, 2022**: Nine months after refusing to provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, the United States reverses course and sends Patriot batteries to Ukraine.
* **January 20, 2023**: Eleven months into the war, the Pentagon argues against sending tanks to Ukraine, saying they won’t get there in time and training on the tanks takes months.
* **January 25, 2023**: Pentagon sends Ukraine 31 M1 Abrams tanks.
* **February 13, 2023**: The U.S. tells Ukraine it won’t send long-range ATACMS missiles because it has few to spare, despite having nearly a whole year of war to increase production.
* **February 24, 2023**: Biden announces he has ruled out sending F-16 aircraft to Ukraine, saying they don’t need the weapons now and that, “we're sending \[Ukraine] what our seasoned military thinks he needs now.”
* **May 11, 2023**: Britain announces that it is providing Storm Shadow missiles to give Ukraine more deep-strike capability. The Biden administration still refuses to transfer ATACMS.
* **May 19, 2023**: Biden administration tells G-7 that it will support a joint training effort for F-16s, despite claiming three months earlier that Ukraine didn’t need them (which they do).
* **April 24, 2024**: Now two years into the war, the Pentagon confirms the transfer of ATACMS despite Kyiv having requested them for over a year.
* **May 29, 2024**: President Biden still refuses to allow Ukraine to conduct strikes on Russian soil using American-supplied weapons even as French and Germany leaders assent.
