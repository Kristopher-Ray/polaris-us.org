* The United States is an exceptional country. We are the only nation to legally welcome over a million new people to our shores on a yearly basis. The convergence of these freedom-loving people over the past hundreds of years has created the most prosperous nation on earth.
* However, Biden fails to uphold his oath of office when he allows more people to illegally invade our borders than he legally welcomes to the United States. Weak immigration enforcement threatens the health and security of our communities and risks thousands more drug overdoses by worsening the disaster at the Southern Border.
