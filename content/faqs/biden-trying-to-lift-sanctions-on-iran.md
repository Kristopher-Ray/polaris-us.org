Biden is trying to lift sanctions on Iran, while they are trying to kill American diplomats like Mike Pompeo and even Biden’s top generals. That’s madness and the very definition of weakness. 

- Biden’s new deal with Iran has been negotiated by the Russians and will give Putin a $10 billion sanctions-free infusion to Russia’s nuclear industry. No wonder Russia’s chief negotiator said Iran got “much, much more than I expected.”
- Iranian terrorists have killed hundreds of American soldiers and chant “Death to America”. We have to stand up against Iran, not give them $90 billion in sanctions relief.  
- Biden’s new Iran deal is the worst negotiated deal is decades – his own political appointees have quit in protest. Congress must reject the deal and block any more blood money going to this evil regime.
