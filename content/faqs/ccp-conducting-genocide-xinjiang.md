* Since 1949, the CCP have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of millions of people through Maoism-induced famines of the Great Leap Forward. The CCP has returned to its savage roots and weaponized a twenty-first century security state in 2014 by placing over one million Muslims of the Uyghur minority group in forced detention camps, where they are subject to brutal torture, forced labor, and brainwashing. This is a massive human rights abuse at a staggering scale.
* In January 2021, Secretary Pompeo formally declared that the CCP was conducting a genocide against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang.
* The Uyghur \[pronounced WE-gur] people are Turkic Muslims in the Xinjiang \[pronounced SEEN-gee-aang] region of China who vary ethnically from the Han culture that dominates the majority of China. The  CCP has violently pursued Uyghurs’ assimilation and dissolution into the rest of Han culture. They use sadistic techniques including sterilizations, forced abortions, and torture to destroy all Uyghur cultural influences.
* The CCP exports Communist Party workers to Xinjiang that move in and live with Uyghur families. Excruciating reports have come out detailing the rapes of Uyghur women, beatings of men, and communist brainwashing of young children.
* The CCP often summons Uyghur citizens to ‘routine’ meetings, only to never be seen again. Many cases involve Uyghurs practicing basic aspects of their faith. Many Uyghurs visiting in China find themselves spending months under inhumane conditions for no reason.
* Despite the ongoing genocide, many American businesses retain deep ties with Xinjiang, which aids the CCP’s persecution. Congress should continue to pass legislation enacting stiff penalties for those who enable the CCP’s genocide and banning products produced through forced labor in Xinjiang.
