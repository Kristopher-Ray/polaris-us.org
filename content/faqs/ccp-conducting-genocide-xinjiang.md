* Under President Trump, Secretary Pompeo declared that China was conducting a genocide against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. Over a million Uyghur people are locked up in concentration camps, subjected to brutal torture and brainwashing. Unfortunately, President Biden hasn’t taken the problem seriously.
* Worse, the Biden Administration is lobbying against other steps to hold China accountable for the Uyghur genocide - there are reports that Wendy Sherman - the Deputy Secretary of State – and John Kerry were lobbying Congress to stop a bill by Marco Rubio that would prevent taxpayers' dollars from supporting the genocide.
* From the moment they took office, President Biden should have worked to organize an alternate Winter Games along with free democracies in Europe - who make up the bulk of competing nations. According to a poll, 60% of Americans say they supported moving or delaying these Olympics. Biden's team dropped the ball here.
* They also should have announced the diplomatic boycott much earlier and then rallied free nations to join our lead as well - instead we're just now at the inflection point when other nations have already decided their participation - that's not exactly an example of bold and decisive leadership.
