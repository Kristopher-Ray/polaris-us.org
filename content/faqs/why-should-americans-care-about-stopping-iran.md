* The Iranian regime has killed hundreds of American citizens, is pursuing a nuclear weapon, and routinely calls for the destruction of the United States and Israel. We must believe our enemies when they publicly proclaim their evil plans and intentions.
* Iran regularly tortures and murders its citizens when they protest, and the regime funnels billions of dollars into supporting terrorist organizations that kill Americans and sow destruction across the Middle East. Hamas’ barbaric October 7th attack did not happen in a vacuum; it was enabled and funded by an emboldened and enriched Iranian regime.
* Right now, Iran is plotting to assassinate at least 10 Americans on U.S. soil. This includes former senior U.S. government officials including Donald Trump, Secretary Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisors John Bolton and Robert O’Brien, General Mark Milley, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and even some of Biden’s national security team. It has even tried to kidnap and kill an American citizen, Masih Alinejad from her home in Brooklyn. If we don’t stop Iran, their terrorists will come to our doorstep and attack us here.
