* The deal would lift sanctions against the regime’s most notorious terrorists, including a terrorist general responsible for the 1983 Beirut Barracks bombing that killed 241 American service members.
* The deal’s restrictions would start expiring before they even start. In just a few years, Iran would be free to build a nuclear weapon with zero consequences or sanctions.
* Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, who led negotiations on behalf of Russia, has crowed that “Iran got much more than it could expect, much more,” and bragged about how Russia teamed up with China and Iran to get dozens of wins over the United States and European negotiating positions.
* Under Biden’s deal, Iran would be free to buy or sell nuclear weapon delivery systems, including ballistic missiles, from Russia or China all legally starting in October 2023.
* The prioritization of Iranian interests over other relations has been dangerous to U.S. national security, the stability of the Middle East, and the Iranian people who suffer most under that brutal regime. Congress must reject any deal emanating from such discussions and force President Biden to get serious about enforcing the sanctions that are required under U.S. law.
* We need to give Israel everything they need to defend themselves against Iranian aggression and the tools they need to destroy Iran’s nuclear program if they decide that is necessary.
