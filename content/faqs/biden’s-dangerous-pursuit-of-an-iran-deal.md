Any nuclear deal reached by the Biden White House would give the Iranian regime at least $90 billion in sanctions relief the regime could use to spread terror across the Middle East with no restrictions. The Biden team is doing everything in its power to sidestep congressional oversight and preserve the ability to renegotiate an agreement.

Instead of understanding the threat from the Iranian regime, Biden’s negotiators deferred to Russian and Chinese diplomats to renegotiate Obama’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the Iranian regime. The outcome has been disastrous.

Now, Congress is investigating evidence that President Biden’s special envoy to Iran, Rob Malley, shared classified material with foreign nationals—behavior for which he allegedly lost his security clearance and was placed on unpaid leave. Senior foreign policy officials divulging national secrets to advance misguided diplomatic efforts is a dereliction of duty and betrayal of the American people.
