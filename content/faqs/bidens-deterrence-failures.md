From the day he took office, President Biden and his team implemented a series of policies that strengthened Putin’s hand, undermined Ukraine, signaled weakness, and demonstrated a dangerous lack of willingness to defend Ukraine. In Biden’s own words, “Putin thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided...he thought he could outlast us.” Here are just a few of the Biden Administration’s actions that laid the groundwork for an invasion:

* **January 20, 2021**: Biden cancels the Keystone XL pipeline and bans all new federal drilling, intensifying European reliance on Russian energy.
* **January 27, 2021**: U.S. announces re-entry into New START Treaty without renegotiating terms favorable to Russia.
* **February 18, 2021**: Biden cancels sanctions blocking Iranian-Russian weapons trade, enabling Iran and Russia to legally conduct arms sales with each other.
* **March 2, 2021**: Biden blocks $150 million in Ukrainian military aid, claiming Ukraine needed certain reforms before receiving weapons.
* **May 7, 2021**: Russian hackers shut down Colonial Pipeline, Biden does nothing, officials say the President “believes in diplomacy”.
* **May 19, 2021**: Biden waives sanctions on Nord Stream 2, a new Russian pipeline to pump gas into Western Europe and isolate Ukraine. T
* **June 18, 2021**: Biden blocks another $100M in weapons for Ukraine, with officials saying they would provide aid if Russia invaded, not beforehand to deter Russia.
* **July 20, 2021**: Biden officials tell Ukrainians to shut up about Nord Stream 2 and to not discuss any details of the deal with Congress.
* **August 15, 2021**: Biden withdraws out of Afghanistan and surrenders to the Taliban, incentivizing Putin to believe the U.S. response to an invasion would be “high on outrage but limited in actual punishment”.
* **November 5, 2021**: Biden rejects Republican calls for stronger presence in Black Sea to deter a Russian invasion.
* **December 12, 2021**: Biden holds Back $200M in Aid amid diplomatic push.
* **January 11, 2022**: Biden officials lobby Senators to oppose sanctions on NS2.
* **January 12, 2022**: Biden tasks Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman, who negotiated deals allowing North Korea to develop a nuclear weapon and Iran to legally develop a nuclear weapon by 2031 with preventing war.
* **January 19, 2022**: Biden says “it’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion” of Ukraine and that they’d have to debate what to do.
* **February 24, 2022**: Russia invades Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration still debates whether it is legal to send military aid to Kyiv, worrying it could be provocative.
