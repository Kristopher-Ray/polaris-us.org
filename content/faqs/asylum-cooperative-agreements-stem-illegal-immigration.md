* During 2019, 71 percent of all illegal border crossers were from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Families made up a majority of crossers, which created a humanitarian crisis and further strained U.S. resources at the border. To stop this, the Trump Administration negotiated with the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to reach ACAs.
* These agreements instantly solved three problems:

  * Families under real persecution in Central America can go to neighboring countries to claim asylum and enjoy protection, rather than travel all the way to the United States.
  * It dissuades would-be migrants from paying top-dollar to deadly drug cartels that guide them on a perilous journey through Mexico to the U.S. Southern Border.
  * Those seeking to falsely claim asylum know they will be denied and not granted access to the United States.
* Biden illegally canceled the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with our partner nations 16 days after he became president with zero replacement plan. Now, human smugglers are richer than ever before. These smugglers take advantage of the most vulnerable and impoverished Central Americans attempting to get the U.S. border, under the premise that the United States will let them in. The consequences for the people making the journey are disastrous.
* The same cartels responsible for the 100,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. through their drug smuggling are enriched by these policies. Cartels and smugglers earned over $1.7 billion every year from human smuggling of Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran migrants to the United States. Between 60-80 percent of women, including children, are raped on the journey. Over 30 percent of kids experience sexual violence.
* President Biden can help stop the border crisis by re-instituting the competent and humane policies that were handed to him. Biden should immediately and permanently re- implement conservative policies that were working to keep the border safe and secure.
