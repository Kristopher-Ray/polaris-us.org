* One of the greatest changes in the modern Middle East happened in the Fall of 2020, when the Abraham Accords brought four peace treaties between Israel and Arab nations. There had been no new peace treaties with Israel since 1994. President Trump and his team got four.
* The Abraham Accords is the formal introduction of diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco—a major step in Muslim nations acknowledging the existence of Israel.
* Israel has defended itself in eight wars since its re-establishment in 1948, fending off countless attacks from Islamic terrorists and members of the Arab League that refused to acknowledge Israel’s existence. While the threat of violence to Israel remains from terror groups on its border, Israel lost four enemies and gained four friends overnight.
* The peace deals ensured that the Middle East would be more peaceful in the future and helps reduce the need for U.S. troops in the region over time.
* President Trump and his team understood how to make peace deals – the world is far safer under Republican leadership that stands with Israel and advances peace instead of Democrat administrations that consistently appease and empower our enemies like Iran.
* The approach from Democrats for decades has been wrong. John Kerry claimed that: “There will be no advance and separate peace between Israel and the Arab World without the Palestinian Process and Palestinian Peace.” John Kerry still failed upwards with a plum Cabinet-level job under Biden.
