**Joe Biden has created a disastrous border crisis that threatens Americans’ security, and it is only getting worse**.

* Even Biden’s Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas admitted the situation at the border is, “worse now than it, frankly, has been in at least 20 years, if not ever.” 
* There is more fentanyl and deadly drugs passing through our border and killing Americans than ever before. Sadly, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug and opioid overdoses in 2021 – that is a direct consequence of Biden’s failure to enforce the law and secure our border. 
* Vicious cartels and human smugglers are waging [full-warfare turf battles](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-army-sends-anti-mine-squads-cartel-turf-82996418) within miles of the United States, going unnoticed in most mainstream media.
* Since President Biden refuses to enforce the law, Congress needs to fund our border agents and fund construction to finish the wall.
