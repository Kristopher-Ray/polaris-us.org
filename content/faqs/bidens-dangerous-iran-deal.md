- Biden’s new deal would give the Iranian regime at least $90 billion in sanctions relief the regime can use to spread terror across the Middle East with ZERO restrictions. 
- The deal lifts sanctions against the regime’s most notorious terrorists, including a terrorist general responsible for the 1983 Beirut Barracks bombing that killed 241 American servicemembers.  
- The deal could lift terrorism sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - Iran’s lead terror arm that is responsible for the regime’s worst crimes and terror attacks on 35 countries around the world. Biden’s own [top generals say](https://twitter.com/SenKevinCramer/status/1504101569683505167) they continue to act as a terrorist organization. 
- The deal’s restrictions on Iran have already started expiring. In nine short years, Iran would be [free to build a nuclear weapon](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/02/19/key-sunsets-under-the-jcpoa-and-unsc-resolution-2231/) with zero consequences or sanctions.
