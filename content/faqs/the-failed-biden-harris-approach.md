* A nation is defined by its borders. If we can’t control who is coming in and out, we aren’t even conducting an essential function of government: providing law and order.
* The root cause of the problem isn’t Central America; it’s 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House’s weakness on crime and illegal immigration has been heard loud and clear. As a direct result, illegal immigration has skyrocketed under President Biden.
* Biden has reversed the successful policies that the Trump administration deployed for security at the southern border. And in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden refused to fully implement CDC orders, packing border patrol jails, and flying illegal immigrants around the country on the taxpayer’s dime.
* Biden illegally reversed Trump programs that keep illegal crossers in Mexico to claim asylum and was forced by the Supreme Court to reinstate this successful program.
* The consequences of Biden’s open-border, open-crime agenda are drastic for vulnerable children. Nearly 130,000 migrant children entered the U.S. government’s shelter system in FY 2022, an all-time high.
* To make matters worse, over 350 individuals on the terrorist watchlist have been apprehended attempting to illegally cross our border between ports of entry since the beginning of FY2021. That’s an over 2,000 percent increase compared to all of FY2017- 2020 and includes individuals from more than 160 countries, including State Sponsors of Terrorism. This number has risen every year of the Biden Presidency, from 15 in fiscal year 2021 to 169 last year. Border Patrol has already encountered 80 illegal border crossers on our terrorist watchlist this fiscal year between ports of entry, leaving us poised to match the FY2023 record of 169 encounters. That should make all of us wonder how many were not apprehended and are already embedded in American cities, waiting to strike the homeland. The Biden Administration is putting the safety of American citizens at risk with its refusal to enforce common sense border policies.
