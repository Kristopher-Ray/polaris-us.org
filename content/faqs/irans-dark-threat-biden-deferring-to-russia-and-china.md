- Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, who led negotiations on behalf of Russia, has crowed that “Iran got much more than it could expect. Much more,” and bragged about how Russia teamed up with China and Iran to get dozens of wins over the United States and European negotiating positions.  
- Next year, Iran is free to buy nuclear weapon delivery systems from Russia or China under Biden’s deal. 
This deal empowers our enemies and abandons our allies – that's why Israel is fighting against it. We must stand with Israel against this horrible deal.  
- Note: Obama’s Iran deal was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The Biden Administration is calling their new deal the JCPOA as well – that's not true – it's a much, much worse deal.   How does the U.S. address this threat?  
- The Trump Administration withdrew from Obama’s weak Iran Nuclear Deal and imposed heavy sanctions on the Iranian regime, depriving them of $200 billion they could have spent on terrorism. We need to re-impose sanctions on Iran until they sign a strong deal that prevents them from EVER getting a nuclear weapon. 
- The deal being negotiated in Vienna is dangerous to U.S. national security, to the stability of the Middle East, and to the Iranian people who suffer most under that brutal regime. Congress must reject this dangerous deal and force the administration to get serious about enforcing the sanctions that are required under U.S. law. 
- Biden has looked the other way as Iran has sold its terror oil around the world and refused to sanction the regime. Those oil sales fund terrorism that is used to kill Americans. Biden’s lawlessness has made our country less safe and the world much more dangerous. We have to replace Iranian oil with American oil production. 
- We need to give Israel everything they need to defend themselves against Iranian aggression and the tools they need to destroy Iran’s nuclear program if they decide that is necessary.
