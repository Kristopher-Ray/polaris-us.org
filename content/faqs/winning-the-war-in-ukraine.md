* If the United States and Europe had sanctioned Russia for massing troops on Ukraine’s border, they would have realized the cost of invading Ukraine. Instead, the Biden Administration has acted like a policeman casually watching a murder unfold so he can arrest the perpetrator after the crime has been committed – instead of stopping the crime from happening in the first place. 
* For the past year, Republicans have been trying to get the Biden Administration to sanction Nord Stream 2. Biden resisted. Republicans tried to get Biden to expedite military assistance to Ukraine. Biden resisted.
* Sanctioning the Russian oligarchs with billions in net worth who support Putin.
* Sanctioning Russian natural resource industries (copper, nickel, timber, machine parts, plastics, oil, chemicals), and top companies like Yandex, United Heavy Machinery, Polyus, and Rosatom.
