* When Border Patrol catches an illegal crosser, they don’t simply make them turn around. They catch them, process them, give them a court date, and release them—not back to Mexico—but in the United States.
* The United States also offers admission and refugee protections to illegal land-border crossers who state a credible fear of political persecution. Our judicial system sets a later date for their asylum proceeding while they remain in the United States.
* As of early 2024, there was a record backlog of three million cases in U.S. immigration courts. That means the average wait for an asylum hearing is over four years! The U.S. federal government effectively gives a free pass into the United States to anyone that says they have a “credible fear” of being in their own country.
* Illegal border crossers with fake asylum claims knew that they would be stuck in Mexico, deterring them from trying to cross in the first place. The U.S. could process legitimate asylum claims faster for those most in need.
* After the Supreme Court forced the reinstatement of MPP, Biden’s officials have only sent a few hundred illegal border crossers back to Mexico, having almost zero effect in stopping millions of illegal immigrants from arriving in the first place.
