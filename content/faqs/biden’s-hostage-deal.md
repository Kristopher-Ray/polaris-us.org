* Last August, the Biden Administration released approximately $6 billion in frozen assets to Tehran in exchange for the release of five Americans held hostage in Evin Prison. Is there anything that encourages U.S. citizen hostage-taking more than paying ransom to America’s enemies?
* The Obama White House gave $1.7 billion – including $400 million in pallets of cash – to Iran in 2016, setting the stage for Americans to be taken across the world. Seven years later, Biden provided a $6 billion ransom payment in direct violation of our longstanding no-concessions policy. Now the price for Americans abroad has risen to $1.2 billion per head.
* While the Blinken State Department insists these funds will only be expended for “humanitarian purposes,” nothing could be further from the truth. Whether applied directly to terrorist and proliferation efforts or indirectly by freeing up finances for those activities, Biden’s ransom payments are fueling the very geopolitical instability the White House purports to object. The Iranian regime must receive isolation for taking hostages, not billions of dollars.
* Thanks to Biden’s concessions to Iran, the United States is also now funding both sides of the war in Ukraine. While we are funding the Ukrainian resistance, we are also providing Iran money to build drones and missiles they sell to Russia to kill Ukrainians.
