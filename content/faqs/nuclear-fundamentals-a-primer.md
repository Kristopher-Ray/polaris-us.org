* While the size of Russian and U.S. nuclear stockpiles historically has been somewhat constrained by arms control treaties, Russia has violated or reneged on these agreements while China refuses to negotiate any limitations to its nuclear stockpile size. After successfully testing a hypersonic missile in 2021, the Chinese military can send conventional or nuclear warheads almost anywhere in the world in minutes with greater maneuverability than air defense systems can counter.
* Outside of testing, nuclear weapons have only been used in war during the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to conclude World War II in 1945, when America was the only nation possessing nuclear technology.
* North Korea and Iran have pursued nuclear weapons to increase their power and threaten their perceived enemies. Leaders of these terror states should never be trusted with nuclear capabilities that could be used to target America and our allies.

**The Way Forward**

* Conservatives know arms control is not an end in itself; it is only as effective as the degree to which treaties are honored. Moscow has no intention of adhering to rules, so why should we self-impose nuclear constraints while rivals build capabilities?
* A weak nuclear deterrent invites aggression from rivals, which is why Biden’s arms control agenda is such a national security peril. With vast superiority in non-strategic and theater nuclear weapons, Russia holds a significant strategic advantage over U.S. forces while China pursues its own strategic breakout. We should not engage in arms control negotiations without Beijing and fail to address all classes of nuclear weaponry.
* Our national security apparatus must do two things: advance our nuclear deterrent and prepare to compete in an arms control-free environment. The Biden Administration should address deficiencies in our nuclear triad and accelerate modernization timelines with funding for programs such as the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile.
