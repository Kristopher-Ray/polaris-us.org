* Israel remains the only democracy in the Middle East, and an indispensable partner in fighting terrorism. We must always fight for Israelâ€™s right to exist from its enemies who want to wipe Israel off the face of the map.
* The Jewish people have been persecuted for millennia and were nearly wiped out by Hitler. The state of Israel grants the Jewish people a place of their own, but they are surrounded on nearly all sides by enemies who have tried to wipe them out.
