When deterrence fails, the only options left are bad and worse. Advocates of a ceasefire seem to forget that there was a ceasefire until October 6, after which Hamas launched an unprecedented terrorist attack. What self-respecting nation would just allow itself to be attacked and not respond decisively?

**Undermining Israel**

* Hours after the hostilities broke out, the Biden administration issued a statement telling Israel to stand down, demanding that “both sides” refrain from violence.
* As early as December 12, Biden accused Israel of indiscriminately bombing Gaza, a war crime. The White House promptly walks it back.
* On February 8, Biden criticizes Israel’s offensive in Gaza as “over the top.” A week later, the White House warned Israel against attacking Rafah without a civilian protection plan despite their best efforts to do so.
* On March 2, Vice President Harris called for an immediate ceasefire for at least six weeks, signaling a decisive evolution in the administration’s position on the issue.
* On March 25, the United States relented to Israel’s critics and abstained on a ceasefire resolution that failed to condemn Hamas, allowing it to be passed by the body.
* After the incident where several World Central Kitchen aid workers were killed, Biden sharply criticized Israel for allowing an inevitable act of collateral damage to ensue.
* When Iran launched 350 missiles and drones at Israel and their air defense systems successfully thwarted 99% of Iran’s projectiles, Biden encouraged Israel to “take the win” rather than retaliate.
* On May 9, the Biden Administration says it will stop sending bombs and artillery shells to Israel if it launches invasion of Rafah, actually increasing the likelihood that civilians will be killed and forcing Israel to use less-precise weapons.
* On May 31, President Biden touted a proposal to settle the conflict in three phases, arguing it is “time for the war to end”—conveniently ahead of the Democratic National Convention
