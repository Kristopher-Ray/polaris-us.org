- Iran has killed hundreds of American citizens, seeks a nuclear weapon, and routinely calls for the destruction of the United States and Israel. The regime is a radical Islamic terror state that proclaims itself as an enemy of the United States. Iran regularly tortures and murders their citizens when they protest, and the regime funnel billions of dollars into supporting terrorist organizations that kill Americans and sow destruction across the Middle East.  
- Right now, Iran is plotting to assassinate senior U.S. government officials including President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, John Bolton, and even Biden’s top generals on U.S. soil. Last year they tried to kidnap an American citizen from her home in Brooklyn. If we don’t stop Iran, their terrorists will come to our doorstep and attack us here.
