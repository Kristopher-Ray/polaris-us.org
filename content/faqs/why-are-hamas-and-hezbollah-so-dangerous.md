* Hamas and Hezbollah are both designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations intent on wiping out the only Jewish state in the world. Yet we now have a caucus of progressives, like Ilhan Omar and AOC “contextualizing” their actions. Sympathy for their cause is rising on college campuses.
* Hamas knows it can’t win a war against Israel or get concessions from them just by firing rockets. Their whole strategy is to play the victim, leverage useful idiots to isolate Israel, and undermine Israel’s security through constant attacks.
* The only reason there aren’t more Israeli civilians dead is because of the Iron Dome that shoots down 90% of Hamas’ rockets - that is a direct result of our support for Israel’s military, and our support to them is vital.
* Their main patron is Iran, who provides them $30 million a month, and gave Hamas the long-range rockets that have been hitting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
