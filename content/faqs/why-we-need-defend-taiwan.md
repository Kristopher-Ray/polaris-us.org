* China wants to bully nations around the world with their military. They’ve used force to expand into islands in the South China Sea. Back in 2014, they built islands out of the water as massive aircraft carriers. It’s all part of their plan to invade Taiwan. We have to stand with Taiwan – they are a peaceful democratic country who stand as a bastion of freedom against Communist China.
* Taiwan has a central role in global semiconductor production that affects U.S. economic and national security. Taiwan represents \~19% of the world’s semiconductor wafer manufacturing capacity. For comparison, mainland China represents \~20%; and while the U.S. leads in global chip design and intellectual property, it weighs in at only ~11% of global capacity.
* As a result, not only does Taiwan represent an important symbol of America’s commitment to a rules-based international order, but it is a key enabler of American economic security as well. Just think of how the chips shortage hurt the car industry. Now imagine China controlling the global chips industry – they would have key leverage over the United States.
* The best way to protect Taiwan is to make sure there’s never a war over the country. The only way to do that is to have a military strong enough to deter China from ever starting a war. That requires a strong military, but Biden is trying to cut defense spending instead of increasing it – while he increases spending on every other category.
