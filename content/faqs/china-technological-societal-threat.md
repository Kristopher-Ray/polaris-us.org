* China is trying to take control of the leading technologies and data about every American. What will they do with this information? The only limit is the imagination of the Chinese Communist Party. They’ve used Western data and technology firms for facial recognition they used to conduct a genocide, they’ve unleashed pandemics, created islands for military bases that may one day be used to attack our aircraft carriers.
* China tries to censor Hollywood – and our elites go along with it. Instead of standing up to China’s vision of oppression, companies line up to make more money. Can you imagine if that happened when the Soviet Union worked to defeat the United States?
* We need to stand up against China across all parts of American society – from higher education to finance, to technology and data. And we need a Congress and a President dedicated to standing up to China – not kowtowing and apologizing.
