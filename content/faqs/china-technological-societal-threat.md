* CCP agents have infused themselves into every facet of American society and seek to leverage their influence to benefit China at our expense. Few forces have been more pernicious than TikTok, a platform that gave Beijing access to troves of data via its parent company, ByteDance, posing a critical threat to our national security. While Congress has finally acted to force its divestiture, it has already spread significant anti- American propaganda and endangered the privacy of millions of American users.
* China has stolen over $600 billion per year in intellectual property through forced technology transfer & intellectual property theft, academic espionage, and forcing cultural appeasement. At one point, the FBI had over 1,000 open investigations into Chinese IP theft; over 1,200 IP theft lawsuits have been brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities in either the United States or China.
* The Trump Administration took China to task for its deceptive economic practices and launched a whole-of-government response. Unfortunately, President Biden has stalled on some of these important initiatives, even shutting down government-wide investigations.
* Many American officials have wrongly assumed that by opening to the world, China would be incentivized to play by international rules, engage in free trade, and democratize. Instead, the CCP used their newfound economic power to increase their authoritarian chokehold in China and expand it abroad.

**Forced Technology Transfer**

* China’s semi-socialist economy often lacks the proper incentives for businesses to innovate and out-compete others in the global economy. As a result, the CCP developed a legal and intelligence framework to cheat and ransack American companies’ IP.
* The CCP has also utilized a coordinated, government-backed, cyber-espionage campaign to steal information from a variety of U.S.-based commercial firms, including those in the oil, energy, steel, and aviation industries.
