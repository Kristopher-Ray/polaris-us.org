* The Chinese military, known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), combined with
  China’s economic and information warfare presents the most capable and aggressive
  threat to U.S. interests and security in our nation’s history. Worse, the Biden
  Administration is not meeting the challenge.
* The Chinese military nuclear build-up is occurring at a rapid pace, far exceeding original
  U.S. intelligence and Pentagon predictions. In 2020 the United States predicted that
  China would hold 400 nuclear warheads by 2030. A year later, the same U.S. prediction
  skyrocketed to 1,000.
* In 2021, the Pentagon revealed that China is equal to or exceeds the United States in
  shipbuilding, land-based ballistic missiles, and integrated air defense systems.
* China’s strategy is based on countering specific U.S. advantages, particularly our more
  advanced air and maritime capabilities. In direct conflict, China would target U.S. aircraft
  carriers in an attempt to handicap the United States’ strongest advantage.
* The Biden Administration recognizes this threat but so far has failed to fund the U.S.
  military at the necessary rate to keep pace with China’s advances, nor has it prioritized
  Great Power Competition as administrations of both parties focused on the Middle East
  and other theatres. Biden refuses to develop a military capable of deterring the CCP’s
  aspirations, leaving Americans and our allies more vulnerable to China’s authoritarian
  rule.
