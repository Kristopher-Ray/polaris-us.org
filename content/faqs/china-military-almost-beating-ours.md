* The Chinese military, known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), combined with
  China’s economic and information warfare presents the most capable and aggressive
  threat to U.S. interests and security in our nation’s history. Worse, the Biden
  Administration is not meeting the challenge.
* The Chinese military nuclear build-up is occurring at a rapid pace, far exceeding original
  U.S. intelligence and Pentagon predictions. In 2020 the United States predicted that
  China would hold 400 nuclear warheads by 2030. A year later, the same U.S. prediction
  skyrocketed to 1,000.
* The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is to overtake the U.S.-led
  order of freedom and democracy and replace it with an authoritarian China-centric order
  in Asia that uses military coercion to advance the CCP’s interests.
* The Biden Administration recognizes this threat but so far has failed to fund the U.S.
  military at the necessary rate to keep pace with China’s advances, nor has it prioritized
  Great Power Competition as administrations of both parties focused on the Middle East
  and other theatres. Biden refuses to develop a military capable of deterring the CCP’s
  aspirations, leaving Americans and our allies more vulnerable to China’s authoritarian
  rule.
