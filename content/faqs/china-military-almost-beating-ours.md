* The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is conducting a buildup at a pace far exceeding initial U.S. intelligence and Pentagon predictions. While the Biden Administration recognizes this threat, it has not developed a deterrence-capable military.
* Two decades ago, the PLA was a low-tech, ground-centric force that operated below the U.S. military across every metric, following former CCP Chairman Deng Xiaoping’s directive to prioritize economic and agricultural modernization first. Since then, the CCP has leveraged access to our military technology to transform the PLA to a high-tech force capable of synchronizing air, naval, ground, and high-tech cyber forces.
* Now, the PLA excels in missile technology and has shaped its force structure to counter specific U.S. advantages, particularly our advanced air and maritime capabilities. In 2021, the Pentagon revealed that China is equal to or exceeds the United States in shipbuilding, land-based ballistic missiles, and integrated air defense systems.
* The PLA’s first priority is maintaining domestic CCP control and regime survival. After that, its focus is the forced capture of Taiwan and the prevention of U.S. intervention through Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD). A2/AD is a military strategy used to prevent your adversary from operating in a specific area with defensive weapons and measures, frustrating their ability to project military power or carry out offensive operations.
* Chinese calculations are carefully formed by watching U.S responses to other global crises. Under President Biden, the Taliban overtook Afghanistan and Russia invaded Ukraine with limp U.S. responses in both disasters. The United States needs to dramatically increase its posture in the Asia-Pacific to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
