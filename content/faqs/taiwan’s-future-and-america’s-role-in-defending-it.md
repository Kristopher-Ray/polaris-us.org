* The CCP declares that any attempt by America to recognize Taiwan’s independence could trigger a military response. To preserve peace in the region and maintain successful economic partnerships, we have held to the One-China policy and refuses to officially recognize Taiwan as independent. Though U.S. political rhetoric emphasizes Taiwan’s sovereignty, an official recognition of independence could invite a stern CCP response.
* Our stance toward Taiwan is known as “Strategic Ambiguity.” We do not officially declare whether we would defend Taiwan in a war in an effort to dissuade China’s military provocation of Taiwan. Additionally, while we treat Taiwan as an independent nation, we refuse to officially acknowledge its independence.
* The United States is bound to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 that establishes unofficial diplomatic relations with Taiwan and stipulates that the U.S. shall provide Taiwan arms of a “defensive character.”
* On four occasions, President Biden has declared the United States would defend Taiwan in a conflict with China, but his White House staff have walked back those statements and reiterated the policy is to maintain the status quo.
* China’s growing authoritarian role in the world runs directly counter to U.S. interests and our security. Beijing’s dangerous ambition to rule the world as it sees fit is a direct threat to U.S. security and global freedom. Taking over Taiwan would be a crucial first step in the CCP’s long-term plan and endanger the United States immensely.
* Taiwan produces 63 percent of semiconductors used in America, a critical component in almost every electronic device, and particularly important amidst a worldwide shortage. Should the CCP gain control of Taiwan, it would control 40 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity and become the world’s technology leader.
* As result, Taiwan represents an important symbol of America’s commitment to a rules-based international order but is also key enabler of U.S. economic security. China controlling the global chips industry would give the CCP unacceptable leverage.
* The best way to protect Taiwan is to make sure there’s never a war in the first place via a successful deterrence strategy. We should support the Taiwanese military with crucial training, elite military equipment, and missile defense systems.
* Taiwan is not only our first line of defense against China. It is a friend to America and a strong democracy. We should always stand with our allies. America needs to ensure that China does not take Taiwan. First, we should send Taiwan plenty of defensive weapons so it can do to China what Ukraine is doing to Russia.
* America successfully maintains regional power in Southeast Asia, along with our allies, Australia, South Korea, and Japan. Together, the alliance helps deters China’s authoritarian claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
* But American taxpayers shouldn’t foot the whole bill. We need to encourage Taiwan to spend more on their defense now, and to buy the right weapons from us. And we should ask our allies in Japan, South Korea, and Australia to share the burden with us.
