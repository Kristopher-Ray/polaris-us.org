The Biden Administration fought off the Nord Stream 2 sanctions before the war. Since Putin’s invasion, they have repeatedly refused to implement meaningful sanctions that would actually deprive the Russian war machine of the resources and funds to continue their rampage.

* Despite Biden’s claims that his steps would cut Russia’s GDP by double digits in 2022, Russia’s economy only shrunk by 2.2 percent. Worse, IMF predictions suggest Russia’ economy will grow by 3.2 percent after making up for lost growth last year.
* Biden said that U.S. sanctions turned the ruble “into rubble.” But the ruble has largely recovered. Its price against the dollar is rallying close to pre-invasion levels.
* Russia earned $180 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2022—a 51 percent increase over its 2021 level. Biden’s sanctions did not deprived the Kremlin of this revenue.
* Treasury’s top officials have been aware of Russia’s blatant sanctions evasion and chosen to ignore it. Instead of sanctioning violators in Turkey, UAE, China, and elsewhere, Treasury officials issue repeated stern warnings, which don’t help Ukraine win a war.
* While the United States has enacted thousands of sanctions on Russia since the start of the war, targeting large numbers of symbolic individuals rather than focusing on key economic industries won’t curtail Russia’s ability to wage war and raise revenue.
* Meanwhile, President Biden refused to sanction fertilizer, industrial equipment, nuclear reactors, plastics, copper, tech sector, vehicles, rubber, nickel, or titanium, which accounted for $50 billion in Russian exports in 2021. Biden also refused to sanction Russian banks, including Bank Saint Petersburg, Bank DOM RF, Bank ZENIT, Uralsib, and The Post Bank.
* Russia’s state-owned nuclear enterprise, Rosatom, experienced the highest annual revenue EVER in 2022, increasing exports by 15% and revenue by 20% over 2021. They continue to work on Iran’s nuclear program with and still sell uranium to the United States and Europe.
