The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a political and military alliance between 30 nations in North America and Europe. It is regarded by many as the most successful military pact in all of human history. The Alliance’s mission is to safeguard allied nations’ security and freedom and provide collective defense of member nations. Collective defense means that an attack on one NATO country is treated as an attack on all countries. This protects members, including America, from threats by other nations and terror groups.

NATO was formed in 1949 in response to the Soviet Union’s expansion in Europe. While the Soviet Union could overpower singular nations, it could never successfully wage a full-scale war against all European nations and the United States when united together. Thus, NATO has served as an effective and longstanding deterrent against nations seeking to invade NATO members. To this day, NATO members have never been invaded by outside enemy forces—a testament to its enduring strategic value.

Russia has never attacked a NATO country. NATO deters Western enemies, namely Russia, and greatly improves the prospect for regional peace. The United States lost over 500,000 men in Europe during WWI and WWII, but since 1945 there has not been a major conflict involving a European NATO state, which has prevented our direct involvement in a war on the continent.
