* The United States is truly exceptional: Nowhere else in all of history, can a country with over 340 million souls with people from every nation come to live together in peace, with freedom, dignity of man, and the rule of law.
* The United States is the only nation in the history of mankind to legally welcome over 1 million new people to its shores on a yearly basis.
* The convergence of these freedom-loving people over the past hundreds of years has created the most prosperous nation on earth.
* Biden fails to uphold his oath of office when he allows more people to illegally invade our borders than he legally welcomes to the United States. 
* President Biden’s weak immigration enforcement threatens the health and security of our communities and risks thousands more drug overdoses by worsening the national security disaster at the Southern Border.
