### What We Do {.sectionTitle .text-uppercase}

- We **support** the Trump Administration’s efforts to deliver peace in the Middle East, secure the Southern Border, win the U.S. competition with China, and ensure American energy dominance.
- We **convene** major events with senior national security officials, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, foreign dignitaries, and prominent leaders across the conservative movement.
- We **educate** political leaders, federal candidates, and others on the ‘Peace Through Strength’ agenda and how to explain these to the American people.
