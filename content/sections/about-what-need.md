### What We Need To Do {.sectionTitle .text-uppercase}

Americans want a Commander-in-Chief who appreciates America’s strength and isn’t afraid to use it to make us secure at home and a beacon of hope and moral clarity around the world. Our president should make us proud, while Biden has only made America surrender.
