### Our Core Mission {.sectionTitle .text-uppercase}

POLARIS National Security’s mission is to serve as the ‘North Star’ for American foreign policy by identifying, promoting, and executing policies that advance U.S. national security.  With rising threats to American values and preeminence, we promote a strong national defense and conservative principles to further U.S. interests at home and abroad.  Our team provides subject-matter expertise and policy materials to key leaders while educating the public through innovative messaging campaigns.
