### What We Need To Do {.sectionTitle .text-uppercase}

For decades, U.S. foreign policy has been failed by decades of myopic strategy by Washington’s political elite.  America’s adversaries have exploited this naïveté to advance their interests at the expense of U.S. national security.

The Biden Administration accelerated this blunder, deviating from its core security mission by pursuing woke distractions and emboldening our adversaries with weakness.  In four short years, the United States suffered a historic collapse of deterrence across the globe.  After ushering in the Taliban’s conquest of Afghanistan thanks to its 2021 retreat, the Biden White House failed to prevent Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine while ignoring the millions of illegal migrants and flows of contraband smuggled across our Southern Border.  It appeased the Iranian regime with sanctions relief and tens of billions of dollars in cash inflows, culminating in October 7, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.

These failures made America less safe and our world more dangerous.

In November, Americans made clear they reject President Biden’s strategy of retreat and are desperate for U.S. leadership to end the chaos and restore order.  President Trump has inherited a more dangerous world than any leader in decades, but history shows us the way forward: answering four years of ‘War Through Weakness’ with four years of ‘Peace Through Strength.’
