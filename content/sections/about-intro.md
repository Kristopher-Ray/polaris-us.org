- We believe that America is strongest when we fully fund and equip our military to achieve peace through strength.
- We believe that America is safer and the world will be more peaceful when our allies respect us and our adversaries fear us. We must demonstrate bold and principled leadership around the world and stand up for our allies and against our enemies.
- We see the threats around the world as they are, not as we wished they would be. We believe we must fight radical Islamic terror groups from ISIS to Al-Qaeda to the Islamic Republic of Iran. We must push back against Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping through words AND deeds. We must expose and degrade the socialist regimes that have turned Cuba and Venezuela into slums.
- We believe America must re-establish energy and supply chain independence. We must not rely on authoritarian nations like China and Russia for the goods to fill our stores and the energy to power our cars, homes, and factories. We should build, invent, invest, and drill in America.
