title: Israel's priority is destroying Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal
date: 2025-06-14T00:42:56.292Z
summary: Israel’s top priority in the very short term is destroying Iran’s
  ballistic missile arsenal, deployment vehicles, and command & control.  They
  did a phenomenal job taking out the IRGC Aerospace leadership - but every
  missile they can take out is a missile that won’t slip through.
