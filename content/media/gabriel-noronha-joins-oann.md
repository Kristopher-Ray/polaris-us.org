summary: Gabriel Noronha joins OANN to discuss Israel's strike on Iran and how
  it was calibrated to send a strong message of deterrence. The purpose was not
  to kill or harm any innocent Iranian citizens but to show they have
  superiority over Iranian airspace and that they can act inside Iran.
