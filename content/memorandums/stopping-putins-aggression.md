title: Stopping Putin’s Aggression
summary: China’s growing authoritarian role in the world runs directly counter to U.S. interests and our security— their dangerous ambition to rule the world as they see fit is a direct threat to U.S. security, our interests, and the interest of freedom in the world. Taking over Taiwan would be a crucial first step in the CCP’s long-term plan and endanger the United States immensely.
