title: Crisis at the Southern Border
summary: "Joe Biden has created a disastrous border crisis that threatens
  Americans’ security, and it keeps getting worse. There is more fentanyl and
  deadly drugs passing through our border and killing Americans than ever
  before. Sadly, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug and opioid overdoses
  in both 2021 and 2022 – that is a direct consequence of Biden’s failure to
  enforce the law and secure our border. "
