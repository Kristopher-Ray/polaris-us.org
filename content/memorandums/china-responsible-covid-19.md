summary: The Chinese Communist Party lied, engaged in a cover-up, and bullied
  anyone that demanded accountably for COVID-19. Worse, Biden did nothing when
  the CCP banned the World Health organization from investigating the origins of
  the virus.

## Key Points: 

- China unleashed a deadly virus on the world, then they lied, arrested, and bullied anyone who tried to tell the truth about dangers of the virus. 
- The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) directly enabled COVID to escape China and infect the world, killing nearly a million Americans. They must be held accountable.  
- The World Health Organization became a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, propagating lies and failing to contain the pandemic. We must not continue to fund them until they reform. 
- President Biden is not holding the CCP accountable. One of Biden first acts as president was to shut down the State Department’s investigation of COVID’s origin. Worse, he rejoined the corrupt World Health Organization and gave them $200 million without asking for accountability.  


> **Let’s get the facts straight: The Chinese Communist Party is responsible for every worldwide death from COVID-19.** In [late 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-idUSKBN1YZ0GP), Chinese doctors in Wuhan discovered a dangerous coronavirus pathogen with pneumonia like symptoms and rapid communal spread. Coincidentally, Wuhan held one of the few coronavirus research centers in the world, just miles from where hospitals reported the first cases. The CCP refused to acknowledge the existence of COVID-19 at this point, and Western media sourced the doctors directly in reports. 

- By [January 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html), Chinese doctors in Wuhan tried to alert the public of the deadly, rapidly spreading virus. The CCP brought the doctors into questioning and forced them to sign a statement denouncing the warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor. Tragically some of these doctors [went missing](https://polaris-us.org/ccp-covid-19-cover-up-1) and have not been seen to this day. 
- On January 12, 2020, Chinese doctors observed [human-to-human](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/02/asia/china-wuhan-covid-truthtellers-intl-hnk-dst/) spread of COVID. The CCP then lied to the world, declaring that there was no human-to-human transmission in COVID-19. On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization repeated and then defended the CCP’s lie. 
- By late January 2020, while thousands of patients with COVID-19 symptoms overwhelmed Wuhan hospitals, the CCP only acknowledged 548 cases. 
Weeks after the deadly pathogen spread rapidly, the CCP imposed a strict lockdown on all the Hubei province affecting 56 million people but kept international travel wide open.  


> Knowing the existence of a deadly and rapidly spreading pandemic on their soil, in **February 2020 the CCP callously [urged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-airlines/chinas-airlines-told-not-to-axe-global-flights-as-thousands-cut-idUSKBN1ZY0E5) domestic airline carriers to continue flying international routes**.

- Despite being prevented by the CCP from truthfully investigating the origins the virus, the World Health Organization repeated China’s lies and also urged continued international travel from China.  
- CCP officials had the audacity to travel to the United States in mid-January 2020 and meet with President Trump in-person during the signing of the historic phase one China trade agreement. At the same time the CCP had shut down much of their country and left the world in the dark. Less than two weeks later, President Trump banned all travel from China.  

### The World Health Organization, funded by $500 million of American taxpayer dollars annually, became a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party. 

Instead of fulfilling its singular mission of controlling pandemics, the WHO caved to Chinese communist pressure and reported lies to the world. 


**Before China fully unleashed COVID-19 to the world in March 2020, the [WHO’s initial report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) proclaimed debunked lies, including:**

- “In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history.” 
- “China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. A particularly compelling statistic is that on the first day of the advance team’s work there were 2478 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in China. Two weeks later, on the final day of this Mission, China reported 409 newly confirmed cases. This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real." 
- While everything clearly indicates that COVID-19’s origin is China, and multiple U.S. government reports hypothesize the virus escaped from a Wuhan lab, the CCP fails to take any responsibility. Instead, the [CCP revoked Western journalists’ visas](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-expels-three-wall-street-journal-reporters-11582100355) for reporting on COVID-19, [sowed lies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html) accusing the United States of starting the pandemic, and [shutdown](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3052966/chinese-laboratory-first-shared-coronavirus-genome-world-ordered) independent Chinese labs that distributed the virus’ genetic sequence.  
- The CCP’s COVID-19 reporting was laughable. While millions contracted the virus around the world and dead bodies overwhelemed Chinese funeral homes, the CCP insisted that deaths and cases inside China remained stable. 


## Biden isn’t standing up to the CCP. 

- Like President Trump, Biden must hold the CCP accountable for their willful negligence that resulted in the death of over 900,000 American citizens.  
- Instead, Biden [shut down](https://nypost.com/2021/05/25/biden-team-shut-down-inquiry-to-prove-lab-link-to-covid-report/) the State Department’s inquiry probing COVID’s origins. 
- Biden [did nothing](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/05/china/china-blocks-who-team-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html) while CCP hindered the World Health Organization investigation into the virus. Worse, his team criticized the Trump Administration’s efforts to get to the bottom of COVID’s origin.
- As long as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in office, the CCP may never have to answer for their crimes. The American people – and the whole world – deserve the truth and they deserve accountability.
