title: The CCP's Genocide in Xinjiang
summary: Since 2014, the CCP has placed over one million Muslims of the Uyghur minority group in forced detention camps. This is a human rights abuse at a scale not observed since Hitler’s concentration camps during the Holocaust. In January 2021, the Trump Administration formally recognized that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing genocide against the Uyghur People.

## Key Points {.text-highlight .text-uppercase}

- The Chinese military, known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), combined with China’s Economic and Information Warfare presents the most capable and aggressive threat to U.S. interests and security in our nation’s history. Worse, the Biden Administration is not meeting the challenge.
- The Chinese military nuclear build-up is occurring at a rapid pace, far exceeding original U.S. intelligence and Pentagon predictions. In 2020 the United States predicted that China would hold 400 nuclear warheads by 2030. A year later, the same U.S. prediction skyrocketed to 1,000.
- The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is to overtake the U.S.-led order of freedom and democracy and replace it with an authoritarian China-centric order in Asia that uses military coercion to advance the CCP’s interests.
- The Biden Administration recognizes this threat but so far has failed to fund the U.S. military at the necessary rate to keep pace with China’s advances, nor has it prioritized Great Power Competition as administrations of both parties focused on the Middle East and other theatres. Biden refuses to develop a military capable of deterring the CCP’s aspirations, leaving Americans and our allies more vulnerable to China’s authoritarian rule.

## Overview {.text-highlight .text-uppercase}

- Two decades ago, the PLA was a low-technology, ground-centric force that steadily operated below the United States’ military across every metric, following Deng’s direction to modernize the economy and agriculture first.
- Since then, the CCP has steadily modeled itself after the US military, leveraging access to our military technology to transform the PLA from a bloated, poorly funded force into a high-tech “informationized” force capable of synchronizing air, naval, ground, and high-tech cyber forces. The CCP excels in missile technology, and has shaped their force structure specifically to counter U.S. military power.
- In 2021, the Pentagon revealed that China is equal to or exceeds the United States in shipbuilding, land-based ballistic missiles, and integrated air defense systems.
- China’s strategy is based on countering specific U.S. advantages, particularly our more advanced air and maritime capabilities. In direct conflict, China would target U.S. aircraft carriers in an attempt to handicap the United States’ strongest advantage.
- The PLA’s first priority is domestic control; it exists to keep the CCP in power. After that, its focus is forced capture of Taiwan, with the goal of preventing US intervention (A2AD). Recent positive commitments from Japan have complicated the PLA’s plans.

- CCP leaders in 2015 highlighted this important shift in their strategic outlook, writing that “The traditional mentality that land outweighs sea must be abandoned, and significant importance has to be attached to managing the seas and oceans."
-  Though the Chinese Navy outpaces the quantity of U.S. ships, the United States will maintain superiority in quality of battleships for the near-term. For instance, the United States projects a global naval-air force with 11 aircraft carriers, while China only has two carriers that are far inferior. The U.S. Navy also has 92 naval destroyers capable of shooting long-range missiles, whereas China has 32.
- President Trump recognized the growing Chinese navy as a problem and championed a rigorous fleet expansion to bring the U.S. Navy to 400 ships within 20 years. President Biden foolishly attempted to reverse course, and reimplement anemic Obama-era defense policies and spending. Thankfully his own Democratic counterparts in Congress sided with President Trump’s vision for a strong U.S. Navy in the Navy’s 2022 budget.
