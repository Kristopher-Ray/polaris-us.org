title: The Americas First
summary: For decades, dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua have
  subjected millions of freedom-loving Latinos to socialist nightmares marked by
  economic collapse, human rights atrocities, and political
  repression.  Patronized by Russia and China, their leaders have gifted
  America’s worst rivals outposts in our hemisphere to surveil the homeland,
  threaten the Panama Canal, isolate Taiwan diplomatically, and extend their
  regional influence.  The United States must hold these repressive regimes to
  account, protect our friends in the region, and treat the regimes of Cuba and
  Venezuela as the pariahs they are.  America’s security begins in the Americas.
