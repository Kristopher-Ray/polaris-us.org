It is critical to remind Americans: President Biden has failed at one of the most important tasks facing American presidents since 1945: preventing wars of conquest on the European continent. The Biden Administration is happy to enable the media hounding conservatives over differences about Ukraine policy, but conservatives must not let Biden off the hook for his deterrence failures.

This war should never have started and with the right policies could have advanced a Ukrainian victory. Instead, Europe continues to experience its most significant land war in generations. There have been three critical faults with Biden’s policy: a failure to deter Moscow, a failure to equip Ukraine, and a failure to weaken Russia’s economy which funds the war effort.

It’s no surprise Putin isn’t scared by President Biden; he already showed he isn’t willing to fight when he abandoned thousands of Americans behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. Biden’s weakness has truly hurt our credibility.

If Biden had sent the systems Ukraine asked for when they needed them, many thousands of Ukrainian lives would have been saved and the odds of peace would have been much higher. Instead, he is pursuing a self-defeating strategy that provides Ukraine enough to prevent loss but not enough to enable victory.
