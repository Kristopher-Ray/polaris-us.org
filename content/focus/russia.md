It is critical to remind Americans: The Biden-Harris Administration has failed at one of the most important tasks facing American presidents since 1945: preventing wars of conquest on the European continent. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are more than happy to enable the media hounding conservatives over differences about Ukraine policy, but conservatives must not let them off the hook for their deterrence failures.

This war should never have started and with the right policies could have advanced a Ukrainian victory. Instead, Europe continues to experience its most significant land war in generations. There have been three critical faults with Biden-Harris policies: a failure to deter Moscow, a failure to equip Ukraine, and a failure to weaken Russia’s economy which funds the war effort.

It’s no surprise Putin isn’t scared of the Biden-Harris Administration; they have already showed they aren't willing to fight when they abandoned thousands of Americans behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. The weakness shown by Biden and Harris has truly hurt our credibility.

If Biden and Harris had sent the systems Ukraine asked for when they needed them, many thousands of Ukrainian lives would have been saved and the odds of peace would have been much higher. Instead, they are pursuing a self-defeating strategy that provides Ukraine enough to prevent loss but not enough to enable victory.
