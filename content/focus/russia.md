title: Halting European Wars
slug: russia
summary: "The Biden Administration failed at one of the most important tasks
  facing American presidents since 1945: preventing wars of conquest on the
  European continent.  The war should never have started and with the right
  policies could have delivered Ukrainian victory far sooner.  Instead, Europe
  remains stuck in its most significant land war in generations three years
  later.  President Trump is determined to restore peace and bring a prompt end
  to this war.  Russia must be deterred from returning to the battlefield â€“ and
  European nations must do their part by stepping up their defenses rather than
  free-riding on NATO and the American taxpayer."
