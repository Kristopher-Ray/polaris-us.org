title: Standing Up To Russia
summary: After years of talk, Biden has failed to deter Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, behind the scenes he has given concessions to Russia. So much for standing up to tyranny.

Joe Biden has failed one of the most important tasks of the U.S. President since 1945: preventing Russia from invading further into Europe. **Biden’s policy of weakness and appeasement is radically dangerous – it already lost us Afghanistan to the Taliban, and now it is causing us to lose Ukraine to Vladimir Putin.**   

- It’s important for the safety, security, and prosperity that we help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.   
- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is already causing energy prices to spike enormously, costing Americans more at the pump and to heat their homes.  
- An invasion would disrupt global trade and Europe’s economy, causing many Americans to lose their jobs and U.S. companies to lose work.   
- Russia taking over Ukraine would bring it even closer to attacking our NATO allies who we have a legal treaty obligation to defend – which would cost even more American lives.   
- We should stand with our democratic friends and against our enemies.
