title: Staying Tough On China
slug: china
summary: The CCP is the greatest danger to America since the Soviet Union. It
  aims to overtake the U.S.-led liberal international order and replace it with
  authoritarianism that uses military coercion to advance China’s interests.
  China threatens our military superiority, economic and technological security,
  and social fabric. But rather than meeting this challenge, Biden has preached
  the importance of cooperation with China and prioritized maintaining good
  relations. Inadequate action has been taken to enhance our defense posture,
  confront the CCP’s manipulative trade practices, block its espionage tactics,
  and deliver accountability to woke companies kowtowing to Beijing.

The Chinese Communist Party is the greatest danger to the United States since the Soviet Union – they threaten us militarily, economically, technologically, and societally. 

Instead of meeting the threat, Biden wants to defund our military, he won’t stand up to China’s manipulative trade practices, he won’t block Chinese technology, and there’s been no action against the woke companies who kowtow to Beijing.

Earlier this year, Biden’s representatives—Secretary of State Blinken and National Security Advisor Sullivan—were openly mocked by China on American soil at the Alaska summit. **Chinese officials lambasted the American negotiators with talking points ripped straight from Critical Race Theory** and told them that the U.S. “does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.”
