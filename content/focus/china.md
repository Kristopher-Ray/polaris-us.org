summary: "The CCP is the greatest danger to America since the Soviet Union. It
  aims to overtake the U.S.-led liberal international order and replace it with
  authoritarianism that uses military coercion to advance China’s interests. But
  Biden's China strategy is predicated on misguided reasoning with one
  overriding priority: avoid conflict. It seeks to manage competition with the
  CCP using accommodation rather than win it with deterrence. And it denies the
  obvious: that we are already in a Cold War with China. Conservatives want to
  keep the peace, but we also understand that policies aimed at avoiding
  conflict often set the conditions for conflict."

The CCP is the greatest danger to America since the Soviet Union. It aims to overtake the U.S.-led liberal international order and replace it with authoritarianism that uses military coercion to advance China’s interests. China threatens our military superiority, economic and technological security, and social fabric. But rather than meeting this challenge, Biden has preached the importance of cooperation with China and prioritized maintaining good relations. Inadequate action has been taken to enhance our defense posture, confront the CCP’s manipulative trade practices, block its espionage tactics, and deliver accountability to woke companies kowtowing to Beijing.

The Biden China strategy is predicated on misguided reasoning with one overriding priority: avoid conflict. It seeks to manage competition with the CCP using accommodation rather than win it with deterrence. And it denies the obvious: that we are already in a Cold War with China. National security conservatives want to keep the peace. But we also understand that policies aimed at avoiding conflict often guarantee the conditions for conflict. The Biden foreign policy signals conciliation to Beijing and that America would rather achieve a temporary thaw in relations than constrain the CCP’s malign behaviors. A strategy that chases amicable ties and elusive climate change goals over defending American interests is doomed to fail.
