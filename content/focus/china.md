summary: Americans know the CCP is the greatest danger to the United States
  since the Soviet Union.  It aims to undermine the democratic rules of the road
  which America and its allies have upheld since World War II and replace them
  with communist authoritarianism and military coercion.  Unfortunately, Biden’s
  China strategy did little to stall the CCP’s rise because believed America
  should use accommodation to manage competition with China rather than win the
  new Cold War with strength and deterrence.  The Trump Administration is
  determined to keep the peace, but it also understands that policies aimed at
  avoiding conflict often set the conditions for conflict.
