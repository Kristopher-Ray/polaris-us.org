The Chinese military, known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), combined with China’s economic and information warfare presents the most capable and aggressive threat to U.S. interests and security in our nation’s history. Worse, the Biden Administration is not meeting the challenge. 

The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is to overtake the U.S.-led order of freedom and democracy and replace it with an authoritarian China-centric order in Asia that uses military coercion to advance the CCP’s interests. 

The Biden Administration recognizes this threat but so far has failed to fund the U.S. military at the necessary rate to keep pace with China’s advances, nor has it prioritized Great Power Competition as administrations of both parties focused on the Middle East and other theatres. Biden refuses to develop a military capable of deterring the CCP’s aspirations, leaving Americans and our allies more vulnerable to China’s authoritarian rule.
