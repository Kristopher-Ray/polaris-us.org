title: The Border Crisis
slug: border
summary: The United States was built by immigrants. But President Biden's failed
  immigration policies are anything but compassionate to Americans, legal
  immigrants, and even illegal migrants trafficked by cartels. The Biden White
  House derelict in its constitutional duty and has dangerously exposed our
  homeland to terrorists and criminals eagerly exploiting open borders. The
  present surge in illegal crossings and inadequate vetting is fueling tragic
  rises in drug trafficking, human smuggling, and abuse across border
  communities. We must restore law and order bring integrity to our immigration
  system.

President Biden’s policies have created a disastrous border crisis that threatens Americans’ security, and it is only getting worse. Even Biden’s Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas admitted the situation at the border is, “worse now than it, frankly, has been in at least 20 years, if not ever.”

There is more fentanyl and deadly drugs passing through our border and killing Americans than ever before. The amount of fentanyl seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) doubled from FY22 to FY23 to a record 27,023 pounds. Tragically, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug and opioid overdoses in 2023 – more than died in the Vietnam War. Many of those deaths are a direct consequence of Biden’s failure to enforce the law and secure our border.

Vicious cartels and human smugglers are waging full-warfare turf battles within miles of the United States, uncovered by most mainstream media. Since President Biden refuses to enforce the law, Congress needs to fund our border agents and fund construction to finish the wall.
