summary: On October 7, Israel experienced the most tragic day in its
  history.  Terrorists mercilessly slaughtered innocent civilians, taking
  hundreds hostage and committing the most evil and unimaginable crimes against
  humanity.  Israel has every right and a moral duty to defend the Jewish people
  against attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iranian terror proxies with
  lethal military force.  America must continue to stand with Israel in its time
  of need.  We applaud and support the Trump Administration in its mission to
  expand the Abraham Accords and advance peace in the Middle East.
