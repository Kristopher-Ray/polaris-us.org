summary: "President Biden’s war on energy had disastrous consequences for the
  American consumer and our economy.  Rather than increasing U.S. production, he
  adopted policies that raised gas prices, forcing us to beg other leaders to
  pump more oil.  That folly was on full display when the White House blocked
  the Keystone Pipeline’s completion while permitting Russia’s Nord Stream 2
  pipeline.  President Trump is bringing an end to these misguided attacks on
  America’s energy industry, but we must redouble efforts to protect our
  homeland by decreasing U.S. reliance on China’s critical minerals supply and
  strengthening our supply chains through innovative partnerships abroad and
  fierce deregulation at home. "
