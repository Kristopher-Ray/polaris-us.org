summary: The Biden Administration’s military budgets consistently fell short of
  our security needs.  Accounting for inflation, they asked Congress to cut
  defense spending four years in a row even as  threats from abroad
  increased.  Thankfully, the Trump Administration is already leading historic
  investments in our military readiness to revitalize our defense industrial
  base and secure America’s freedom for the next generation.  It is also working
  to restore public trust in the military apolitical ethos by refocusing on
  lethality and eliminating divisive distractions.  We must continue to ensure
  the U.S. military remains the world’s largest and most powerful to keep the
  peace with American strength.
