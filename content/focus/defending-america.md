The Biden-Harris Administration proposed military budgets have consistently fallen short of our defense needs, even as external security threats mount. Accounting for inflation, Biden and Harris have now asked Congress to cut military spending four years in a row even as they demand massive budget increases for domestic progressive priorities.

The Biden-Harris Administration talks tough about stopping autocracies and partnering with liberal democracies. But what message is the United States sending when our President won’t even fund our defense properly? America’s international reputation hinges on our ability to maintain a forward military presence and lethal forces that can win wars.
