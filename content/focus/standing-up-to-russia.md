The Chinese Communist Party is the greatest danger to the United States since the Soviet Union – they threaten us militarily, economically, technologically, and societally.

Instead of meeting the threat, Biden wants to defund our military, he won’t stand up to China’s manipulative trade practices, he won’t block Chinese technology, and there’s been no action against the woke companies who kowtow to Beijing.

Earlier this year, Biden’s representatives—Secretary of State Blinken and National Security Advisor Sullivan—were openly mocked by China on American soil at the Alaska summit. Chinese officials lambasted the American negotiators with talking points ripped straight from Critical Race Theory and told them that the U.S. “does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.”
