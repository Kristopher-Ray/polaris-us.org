summary: On day one, the Biden Administration jettisoned President Trump’s
  “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted the Obama-era policies that
  empowered the Iranian regime. Biden orchestrated an unprecedented sanctions
  relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism that has provided the

On day one, the Biden Administration jettisoned President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted the Obama-era policies that empowered the Iranian regime. Biden orchestrated an unprecedented sanctions relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism that has provided the regime access to around $100 billion dollars in ransom payments and oil sales, many of which have been diverted to support Tehran’s terrorist proxies.

President Biden’s record on Iran is abysmal. These decisions have advanced Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony, allowed its affiliates to destabilize the Middle East with impunity, and endangered the lives of American expats in the region. And they were taken even as Tehran tries to kill American diplomats like Mike Pompeo and even Biden’s top generals. That’s madness and the very definition of weakness.
