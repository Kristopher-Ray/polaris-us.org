summary: On day one, the Biden-Harris Administration jettisoned President
  Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted Obama-era policies that
  empowered the Iranian regime. Biden and Harris orchestrated unprecedented
  sanctions relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, providing
  the regime access to around $100 billion dollars in ransom payments and oil
  sales—much of which have been diverted to Tehran’s terrorist proxies. These
  decisions have advanced Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony, allowed its
  affiliates to destabilize the Middle East, and endangered the lives of
  American expats in the region. Even Democrats on Capitol Hill are sounding the
  alarm on his repeated appeasements.

On day one, the Biden-Harris Administration jettisoned President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted the Obama-era policies that empowered the Iranian regime. Biden and Harris orchestrated an unprecedented sanctions relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism that has provided the regime access to around $100 billion dollars in ransom payments and oil sales, many of which have been diverted to support Tehran’s terrorist proxies.

Biden and Harris' record on Iran is abysmal. These decisions have advanced Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony, allowed its affiliates to destabilize the Middle East with impunity, and endangered the lives of American expats in the region. And they were taken even as Tehran tries to kill American diplomats like Mike Pompeo and even top generals in the Biden-Harris Administration. That’s madness and the very definition of weakness.
