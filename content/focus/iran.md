On day one, the Biden Administration jettisoned President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted the Obama-era policies that empowered the Iranian regime. Biden orchestrated an unprecedented sanctions relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism that has provided the regime access to around $100 billion dollars in ransom payments and oil sales, many of which have been diverted to support Tehran’s terrorist proxies.

President Biden’s record on Iran is abysmal. These decisions have advanced Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony, allowed its affiliates to destabilize the Middle East with impunity, and endangered the lives of American expats in the region. And they were taken even as Tehran tries to kill American diplomats like Mike Pompeo and even Biden’s top generals. That’s madness and the very definition of weakness.

We know what a second Biden term would bring: A new Iran deal that would be among the worst negotiated deal is decades. In the first term, Biden’s own political appointees quit in protest of his policies, his Iran Envoy has been under criminal investigation by the FBI, and even Democrats in Capitol Hill are sounding the alarm of his policies. Congress must reject Biden’s repeated appeasements and block any more blood money going to this evil regime.

Iranian terrorists have killed hundreds of American soldiers and chant “Death to America.” We have to stand up against Iran, not give them billions in sanctions relief.
