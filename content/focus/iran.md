summary: On day one, the Biden Administration abandoned the ‘Maximum Pressure’
  campaign and re-embraced Obama-era policies that empowered Tehran.  They
  orchestrated unprecedented sanctions relief on the world’s leading state
  sponsor of terrorism, providing the regime access to over $100 billion dollars
  via oil sales and ransom payments.  Much of this funding was diverted to Hamas
  and Hezbollah for their attacks on Israel.  But President Trump’s national
  security team is putting Iran’s leaders on notice, showing that its proxy wars
  won’t be tolerated, and that America and Israel will never allow them to
  acquire a nuclear weapon. Americans should cheer on the Trump Administration
  as it advances the Maximum Pressure Campaign on the Islamic Republic of Iran,
  the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.

On day one, the Biden-Harris Administration jettisoned President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and re-adopted the Obama-era policies that empowered the Iranian regime. Biden and Harris orchestrated an unprecedented sanctions relief on the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism that has provided the regime access to around $100 billion dollars in ransom payments and oil sales, many of which have been diverted to support Tehran’s terrorist proxies.

Biden and Harris' record on Iran is abysmal. These decisions have advanced Iran’s pursuit of regional hegemony, allowed its affiliates to destabilize the Middle East with impunity, and endangered the lives of American expats in the region. And they were taken even as Tehran tries to kill American diplomats like Mike Pompeo and even top generals in the Biden-Harris Administration. That’s madness and the very definition of weakness.
